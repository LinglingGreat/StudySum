" 13 December 2017, at 09:26.","For the political term, see ,Benevolent dictatorship,.,
,Benevolent Dictator For Life, (,BDFL,) is a title given to a small number of ,open-source software development, leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to ,Guido van Rossum,, creator of the ,Python programming language,.,[1],[2], Shortly after van Rossum joined the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by ,Ken Manheimer, to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included the additional joke of naming van Rossum the "",First Interim, BDFL"".,[1],
,BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, "",benevolent dictator,"", which was popularized by ,Eric S. Raymond,'s essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (1999).,[3], Among other topics related to ,hacker culture,, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself ,benevolent,, since a strong disagreement can lead to the ,forking, of the project under the rule of new leaders.,

,Ruby on Rails,, or ,Rails,, is a server-side ,web application framework, written in ,Ruby, under the ,MIT License,. Rails is a ,model–view–controller, (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a ,database,, a ,web service,, and ,web pages,. It encourages and facilitates the use of ,web standards, such as ,JSON, or ,XML, for data transfer, and ,HTML,, ,CSS, and ,JavaScript, for display and user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known ,software engineering, ,patterns, and paradigms, including ,convention over configuration, (CoC), ,don't repeat yourself, (DRY), and the ,active record pattern,.,[4],
,Ruby on Rails' emergence in the 2000s greatly influenced web app development, through innovative features such as seamless database table creations, migrations, and scaffolding of views to enable rapid application development. Ruby on Rails' influence on other web frameworks remains apparent today, with many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas, including ,Django, in ,Python,, ,Laravel, in ,PHP,, Phoenix in ,Elixir,, and ,Sails.js, in ,Node.js,.,

,History,[,edit,],
,David Heinemeier Hansson, extracted Ruby on Rails from his work on the project management tool ,Basecamp, at the ,web application, company also called ,Basecamp,.,[5], Hansson first released Rails as open source in July 2004, but did not share ,commit, rights to the project until February 2005.,[,citation needed,], In August 2006, the framework reached a milestone when ,Apple, announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails with ,Mac OS X v10.5 ""Leopard"",,,[6], which was released in October 2007.,
,Rails version 2.3 was released on March 15, 2009 with major new developments in templates, engines, ,Rack, and nested model forms. Templates enable the developer to generate a skeleton application with custom ,gems, and configurations. Engines give developers the ability to reuse application pieces complete with routes, view paths and models. The Rack web server interface and Metal allow one to write optimized pieces of code that route around Action Controller.,[7],
,On December 23, 2008, ,Merb,, another web application framework, was launched, and Ruby on Rails announced it would work with the Merb project to bring ""the best ideas of Merb"" into Rails 3, ending the ""unnecessary duplication"" across both communities.,[8], Merb was merged with Rails as part of the Rails 3.0 release.,[9],[10],
,Rails 3.1 was released on August 31, 2011, featuring Reversible Database Migrations, Asset Pipeline, Streaming, ,jQuery, as default ,JavaScript, library and newly introduced ,CoffeeScript, and ,Sass, into the stack.,[11],
,Rails 3.2 was released on January 20, 2012 with a faster development mode and routing engine (also known as Journey engine), Automatic Query Explain and Tagged Logging.,[12], Rails 3.2.x is the last version that supports Ruby 1.8.7.,[13], Rails 3.2.12 supports Ruby 2.0.,[14],
,Rails 4.0 was released on June 25, 2013, introducing Russian Doll Caching, Turbolinks, Live Streaming as well as making Active Resource, Active Record Observer and other components optional by splitting them as gems.,[15],
,Rails 4.1 was released on April 8, 2014, introducing Spring, Variants, Enums, Mailer previews, and secrets.yml.,[16],
,Rails 4.2 was released on December 19, 2014, introducing Active Job, asynchronous emails, Adequate Record, Web Console, and ,foreign keys,.,[17],
,Rails 5.0 was released on June 30, 2016, introducing Action Cable, API mode, and Turbolinks 5.,[18],
,Rails 5.0.0.1 was released on August 10, 2016 with Exclusive use of rails CLI over Rake and supports Ruby 2.2.2+ versions,
,Rails 5.1 was released on April 27, 2017, introducing ,JavaScript, integration changes (management of JavaScript dependencies from NPM via Yarn, optional compilation of JavaScript using ,Webpack,, and a rewrite of Rails UJS to use vanilla JavaScript instead of depending on jQuery), system tests using ,Capybara,, encrypted secrets, parameterized mailers, direct & resolved routes, and a unified form_with helper replacing the form_tag/form_for helpers.,[19],

,Technical overview,[,edit,],
,Like many web frameworks, Ruby on Rails uses the ,model–view–controller, (MVC) pattern to organize application programming.,
,In a default configuration, a ,model, in the Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database and to a Ruby file. For example, a model class ,User, will usually be defined in the file 'user.rb' in the app/models directory, and linked to the table 'users' in the database. While developers are free to ignore this convention and choose differing names for their models, files, and database table, this is not common practice and is usually discouraged in accordance with the ""convention-over-configuration"" philosophy.,
,A ,controller, is a server-side component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes how to respond to a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use ,RESTful, routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.,
,A ,view, in the default configuration of Rails is an ,erb, file, which is evaluated and converted to ,HTML, at run-time. Alternatively, many other templating systems can be used for views.,
,Ruby on Rails includes tools that make common development tasks easier ""out-of-the-box"", such as ,scaffolding, that can automatically construct some of the models and views needed for a basic ,website,.,[30], Also included are ,WEBrick,, a simple Ruby web server that is distributed with Ruby, and ,Rake,, a build system, distributed as a ,gem,. Together with Ruby on Rails, these tools provide a basic development environment.,
,Ruby on Rails is most commonly not connected to the Internet directly, but through some front-end ,web server,. ,Mongrel, was generally preferred,[,by whom?,], over WEBrick in the early days,,[,citation needed,], but it can also run on ,Lighttpd,, ,Apache,, ,Cherokee,, ,Hiawatha,, ,Nginx, (either as a module – ,Phusion Passenger, for example – or via ,CGI,, ,FastCGI, or ,mod_ruby,), and many others. From 2008 onward, Passenger replaced Mongrel as the most-used web server for Ruby on Rails.,[31], Ruby is also supported natively on the ,IBM i,.,[32],
,Ruby on Rails is also noteworthy for its extensive use of the ,JavaScript, libraries, ,Prototype, and ,Script.aculo.us,, for scripting ,Ajax, actions.,[33], Ruby on Rails initially utilized lightweight ,SOAP, for web services; this was later replaced by RESTful ,web services,. Ruby on Rails 3.0 uses a technique called ,Unobtrusive JavaScript, to separate the functionality (or logic) from the structure of the web page. jQuery is fully supported as a replacement for Prototype and is the default JavaScript library in Rails 3.1, reflecting an industry-wide move towards jQuery. Additionally, ,CoffeeScript, was introduced in Rails 3.1 as the default JavaScript language.,
,Since version 2.0, Ruby on Rails offers both HTML and XML as standard output formats. The latter is the facility for RESTful web services.,
,Rails 3.1 introduced ,Sass, as standard ,CSS, templating.,
,By default, the server uses ,Embedded Ruby, in the HTML views, with files having an html.erb extension. Rails supports swapping-in alternative templating languages, such as ,HAML, and ,Mustache,.,
,Ruby on Rails 3.0 has been designed to work with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.2, and ,JRuby, 1.5.2+; earlier versions are not supported.,[34],
,Ruby on Rails 3.2 is the last series of releases that support Ruby 1.8.7.,
,Framework structure,[,edit,],
,Ruby on Rails is separated into various packages, namely ,ActiveRecord, (an ,object-relational mapping, system for database access), Active Resource (provides web services), Action Pack, Active Support and Action Mailer. Prior to version 2.0, Ruby on Rails also included the Action Web Service package that is now replaced by Active Resource. Apart from standard packages, developers can make ,plugins, to extend existing packages. Earlier Rails supported plugins within their own custom framework; version 3.2 deprecates these in favor of standard Ruby ""gems"".,[35],
,Deployment,[,edit,],
,Ruby on Rails is often installed using ,RubyGems,, a package manager,[36], which is included with current versions of Ruby. Many free ,Unix-like systems, also support installation of Ruby on Rails and its dependencies through their native ,package management system,.,
,Ruby on Rails is typically deployed with a database server such as ,MySQL, or ,PostgreSQL,, and a web server such as ,Apache, running the ,Phusion Passenger, module.,
,Philosophy and design,[,edit,],
,Ruby on Rails is intended to emphasize ,Convention over Configuration, (CoC), and the ,Don't Repeat Yourself, (DRY) principle.,
,""Convention over Configuration"" means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class ,Sales, in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called ,sales, by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table ""products sold"", that the developer needs to write code regarding these names. Generally, Ruby on Rails conventions lead to less code and less repetition.,[37],
,""Don't repeat yourself"" means that information is located in a single, unambiguous place. For example, using the ,ActiveRecord, module of Rails, the developer does not need to specify database column names in class definitions. Instead, Ruby on Rails can retrieve this information from the database based on the class name.,
,""Fat models, skinny controllers"" means that most of the application logic should be placed within the model while leaving the controller as light as possible.,
,Trademarks,[,edit,],
,In March 2007, ,David Heinemeier Hansson, filed three Ruby on Rails-related ,trademark, applications to the ,USPTO,. These applications regard the phrase ""RUBY ON RAILS"",,[38], the word ""RAILS"",,[39], and the official Rails logo.,[40], As a consequence, in the summer of 2007, Hansson denied permission to ,Apress, to use the Ruby on Rails logo on the cover of a new Ruby on Rails book written by some authoritative community members. The episode gave rise to a polite protest in the Ruby on Rails community.,[41],[42], In response to this criticism, Hansson replied:,
,
,I only grant promotional use [of the Rails logo] for products I'm directly involved with. Such as books that I've been part of the development process for or conferences where I have a say in the execution. I would most definitely seek to enforce all the trademarks of Rails.,[41],
,
,Reception,[,edit,],
,Scalability,[,edit,],
,Rails running on ,Matz's Ruby Interpreter, (the ,de facto, reference interpreter for Ruby) had been criticized for issues with scalability.,[43], These critics often mentioned various ,Twitter, outages in 2007 and 2008, which spurred Twitter's partial transition to ,Scala, (which runs on the ,Java Virtual Machine,) for their ,queueing system, and other ,middleware,.,[44],[45], The user interface aspects of the site continued to run Ruby on Rails,[46], until 2011 when it was replaced due to concerns over performance,[47],
,In 2011, ,Gartner Research, noted that despite criticisms and comparisons to Java, many high-profile consumer web firms are using Ruby on Rails to build scalable web applications. Some of the largest sites running Ruby on Rails include ,Airbnb,, ,GitHub,, ,Scribd,, ,Shopify,, ,Hulu,, and ,Basecamp,.,[48], As of January 2016, it is estimated that more than 1.2 million web sites are running Ruby on Rails.,[49],[50],
,Security,[,edit,],
,In March 2012, security researcher Egor Homakov discovered a ""mass assignment"" vulnerability that allowed certain Rails applications to be remotely exploited, and demonstrated it by non-maliciously hacking ,GitHub, after his earlier attempts at responsible disclosure were dismissed.,[51],
,On September 24, 2013, a session cookie persistence security flaw was reported in Ruby on Rails. In a default configuration, the entire session hash is stored within a session cookie known as ,CookieStore,, allowing any authenticated session possessing the session cookie to log in as the target user at any time in the future. As a workaround, administrators are advised to configure cookies to be stored on the server using mechanisms such as ,ActiveRecordStore,.,[52],
,Researchers Daniel Jackson and Joseph Near developed a data debugger they called ""Space"" that can analyze the data access of a Rails program and determine if the program properly adheres to rules regarding access restrictions. On April 15, 2016, Near reported that an analysis of 50 popular Web applications using Space uncovered 23 previously unknown security flaws.,[53],

,In 1999, Hansson founded and built a Danish online gaming news website and community called Daily Rush, which he ran until 2001.,[4],
,After attracting the attention of ,Jason Fried, by offering him help with PHP coding, Hansson was hired by Fried to build a web-based ,project management, tool, which ultimately became 37signals' ,Basecamp, ,software as a service, product.,
,To aid the development process, Hansson used the then-obscure Ruby programming language to develop a custom ,web framework,. He released the framework separately from the project management tool in 2004 as the ,open source, project ,Ruby on Rails,. In 2005, Hansson was recognized by ,Google, and ,O'Reilly, with the ""Hacker of the Year"" award for his creation of Ruby on Rails.,[5],
,After graduating from the ,Copenhagen Business School, and receiving his ,bachelor's degree, in Computer Science and Business Administration, Hansson moved from ,Denmark, to ,Chicago,, Illinois, ,U.S., in November 2005.,[6],

,Laravel, is a ,free,, open-source,[4], PHP ,web framework,, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the ,model–view–controller, (MVC) ,architectural pattern,. Some of the features of Laravel are a modular ,packaging system, with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing ,relational databases,, utilities that aid in ,application deployment, and maintenance, and its orientation toward ,syntactic sugar,.,[5],[6],:,2,5–9,[7],[8],
,As of March 2015,[update],, Laravel is regarded as one of the most popular ,PHP, frameworks, together with ,Symfony,, Zend, ,CodeIgniter,, ,Yii2, and others.,[6],:,1,[9],

,History,[,edit,],
,Taylor Otwell created Laravel as an attempt to provide a more advanced alternative to the CodeIgniter framework, which did not provide certain features such as built-in support for user ,authentication, and ,authorization,. Laravel's first ,beta release, was made available on June 9, 2011, followed by the Laravel 1 release later in the same month. Laravel 1 included built-in support for authentication, ,localisation,, ,models,, ,views,, ,sessions,, routing and other mechanisms, but lacked support for ,controllers, that prevented it from being a true ,MVC, framework.,[1],
,Laravel 2 was released in September 2011, bringing various improvements from the author and community. Major new features included the support for controllers, which made Laravel 2 a fully MVC-compliant framework, built-in support for the ,inversion of control, (IoC) principle, and a ,templating system, called ,Blade,. As a downside, support for third-party ,packages, was removed in Laravel 2.,[1],
,Laravel 3 was released in February 2012 with a set of new features including the ,command-line interface, (CLI) named ,Artisan,, built-in support for more ,database management systems,, database migrations as a form of ,version control, for database layouts, support for handling ,events,, and a packaging system called ,Bundles,. An increase of Laravel's userbase and popularity lined up with the release of Laravel 3.,[1],
,Laravel 4, codenamed ,Illuminate,, was released in May 2013. It was made as a complete rewrite of the Laravel framework, migrating its layout into a set of separate packages distributed through ,Composer,, which serves as an ,application-level package manager,. Such a layout improved the extensibility of Laravel 4, which was paired with its official regular release schedule spanning six months between minor ,point releases,. Other new features in the Laravel 4 release include ,database seeding, for the initial population of databases, support for ,message queues,, built-in support for sending different types of email, and support for delayed deletion of database records called ,soft deletion,.,[1],[11],:,18–19,
,Laravel 5 was released in February 2015 as a result of internal changes that ended up in renumbering the then-future Laravel 4.3 release. New features in the Laravel 5 release include support for scheduling periodically executed tasks through a package called ,Scheduler,, an abstraction layer called ,Flysystem, that allows remote storage to be used in the same way as local ,file systems,, improved handling of package assets through ,Elixir,, and simplified externally handled authentication through the optional ,Socialite, package. Laravel 5 also introduced a new internal ,directory tree, structure for developed applications.,[6],:,13–14,[12],
,Laravel 5.1, released in June 2015, is the first release of Laravel to receive ,long-term support, (LTS), with planned availability of ,bug fixes, for two years and ,security patches, for three years. LTS releases of Laravel are planned to be released every two years.,[13],
,Laravel 5.3, released in August 23, 2016, The new features in 5.3 are focused on improving developer speed by adding additional out of the box improvements for common tasks.,[14], ,[15],
,Laravel 5.4, released in January 24, 2017, This release has many new features, like Laravel Dusk, Laravel Mix, Blade Components and Slots, Markdown Emails, Automatic Facades, Route Improvements, Higher Order Messaging for Collections, and many others.,[16],
,Laravel 5.5, released in August 30, 2017,
,Release history,[,edit,],
,For LTS releases, such as Laravel 5.1, bug fixes are provided for 2 years and security fixes are provided for 3 years. These releases provide the longest window of support and maintenance. For general releases, bug fixes are provided for 6 months and security fixes are provided for 1 year.,[17],

,Features,[,edit,],
,The following features serve as Laravel's key design points (where not specifically noted, descriptions refer to the features of Laravel 3):,[5],[6],:,5–9,[7],[8],[19],
,
,Bundles, provide a modular ,packaging system, since the release of Laravel 3, with bundled features already available for easy addition to applications. Furthermore, Laravel 4 uses Composer as a dependency manager to add framework-agnostic and Laravel-specific PHP packages available from the ,Packagist, repository.,[20],
,Eloquent ORM, (,object-relational mapping,) is an advanced PHP implementation of the ,active record pattern,, providing at the same time internal methods for enforcing constraints on the relationships between ,database, objects. Following the active record pattern, Eloquent ORM presents ,database tables, as ,classes,, with their ,object instances, tied to single ,table rows,.,[21],[22],
,Query builder,, available since Laravel 3, provides a more direct database access alternative to the Eloquent ORM. Instead of requiring ,SQL queries, to be written directly, Laravel's query builder provides a set of classes and ,methods, capable of building queries programmatically. It also allows selectable ,caching, of the results of executed queries.,[23],
,Application logic, is an integral part of developed applications, implemented either by using ,controllers, or as part of the route declarations. The ,syntax, used to define application logic is similar to the one used by ,Sinatra, framework.,
,Reverse routing, defines a relationship between the links and routes, making it possible for later changes to routes to be automatically propagated into relevant links. When the links are created by using names of existing routes, the appropriate ,uniform resource identifiers, (URIs) are automatically created by Laravel.,
,Restful controllers, provide an optional way for separating the logic behind serving ,HTTP GET, and ,POST, requests.,
,Class auto loading, provides automated loading of PHP classes without the need for manual maintenance of inclusion paths. On-demand loading prevents inclusion of unnecessary components, so only the actually used components are loaded.,
,View, composers, serve as customizable logical code units that can be executed when a view is loaded.,
,Blade, ,templating engine, combines one or more templates with a ,data model, to produce resulting views, doing that by ,transpiling, the templates into cached PHP code for improved performance. Blade also provides a set of its own ,control structures, such as ,conditional statements, and ,loops,, which are internally mapped to their PHP counterparts. Furthermore, Laravel services may be called from Blade templates, and the templating engine itself can be extended with custom directives.,[24],[25],
,IoC containers, make it possible for new objects to be generated by following the ,inversion of control, (IoC) principle, in which the framework calls into the application- or task-specific code, with optional instantiating and referencing of new objects as ,singletons,.,
,Migrations, provide a ,version control, system for ,database schemas,, making it possible to associate changes in the application's ,codebase, and required changes in the database layout. As a result, this feature simplifies the ,deployment, and updating of Laravel-based applications.,[26],
,Database seeding, provides a way to populate database tables with selected default data that can be used for application ,testing, or be performed as part of the initial application setup.,[26],
,Unit testing, is provided as an integral part of Laravel,,[11],:,61–62, which itself contains unit tests that detect and prevent ,regressions, in the framework. Unit tests can be run through the provided ,artisan, ,command-line utility,.,
,Automatic pagination, simplifies the task of implementing pagination, replacing the usual manual implementation approaches with automated methods integrated into Laravel.,
,Form request, is a feature of Laravel 5 that serves as the base for ,form, input validation by internally binding ,event, listeners, resulting in automated invoking of the form validation methods and generation of the actual form.,[27],
,Homestead, - a ,Vagrant, ,virtual machine, that provides Laravel developers with all the tools necessary to develop Laravel straight out of the box, including, ,Ubuntu,, ,Gulp, , Bower and other development tools that are useful in developing full scale web applications.,[28],
,
,Featured packages,[,edit,],
,Ready-to-use bundles provided by Laravel through Composer and Packagist include the following:,[3],
,
,Cashier,, introduced in Laravel 4.2, provides an interface for managing subscription billing services provided by ,Stripe,, such as handling ,coupons, and generating ,invoices,.,
,SSH,, introduced in Laravel 4.1, allows programmatic execution of ,CLI, commands on remote servers using the ,Secure Shell, (SSH) as an encrypted ,network protocol,.,
,Scheduler,, introduced in Laravel 5.0, is an addition to the Artisan that allows programmatic scheduling of periodically executed tasks. Internally, Scheduler relies on the ,cron, daemon to run a single Artisan job that, in turn, executes the configured tasks.,
,Flysystem,, introduced in Laravel 5.0, is a ,file system, abstraction layer that allows local file systems and ,cloud,-based storage services provided by ,Amazon S3, and ,Rackspace Cloud, to be used transparently and in the same way.,
,Socialite,, introduced in Laravel 5.0 as an optional package, provides simplified mechanisms for authentication with different ,OAuth, providers, including ,Facebook,, ,Twitter,, ,Google,, ,GitHub, and ,Bitbucket,.,[6],:,13,
,
,Artisan CLI,[,edit,],
,Laravel's ,command-line interface, (CLI), called ,Artisan,, was initially introduced in Laravel 3 with a limited set of capabilities. Laravel's later migration to a Composer-based architecture allowed Artisan to incorporate different components from the ,Symfony, framework, resulting in the availability of additional Artisan features in Laravel 4.,[11],:,73–83,[29],
,The features of Artisan are mapped to different subcommands of the ,artisan, command-line utility, providing functionality that aids in managing and building Laravel-based applications. Common uses of Artisan include managing database migrations and seeding, publishing package assets, and generating ,boilerplate code, for new controllers and migrations; the latter frees the developer from creating proper code ,skeletons,. The functionality and capabilities of Artisan can also be expanded by implementing new custom commands, which, for example, may be used to automate application-specific recurring tasks.,[11],:,73–83,[29],
,Server requirements,
,The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. Of course, all of these requirements are satisfied by the Laravel Homestead virtual machine, so it is highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.,
,However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:,
,
  ,• PHP >= 7.0.0,
  • OpenSSL PHP Extension
  • PDO PHP Extension
  • Mbstring PHP Extension
  • Tokenizer PHP Extension
  • XML PHP Extension
,
,Conferences,[,edit,],
,Laracon, is the official Laravel conference centered around the Laravel framework, covering its development, uses, and related general ,software development, topics. Laracon has taken place in the ,United States,, ,Europe, and online in the past.,[30],[31], Typically, the conference happens in the ,United States, and ,Europe, every year. 2017 was the first year a Laracon was held as an online event only. As of March 2017, there are plans for more Laracons to be held online in the future.,[32], Each year the conference has a different variety of sponsors and organizers, but Laravel, Laravel News and UserScape are usually the primary organizers. As of March 2017,[update],, the following Laracons have been held or are announced:,

,DNN, (formerly ,DotNetNuke,) is a ,web content management system, based on ,Microsoft .NET,. The DNN Platform Edition is ,open source,.,
,DNN is written in ,C#,, though it existed for many years as a ,VB.NET, project.,[5],[6], It is distributed under both a Community Edition ,MIT, license ,[4], and commercial proprietary licenses as DNN Evoq Content and DNN Evoq Engage editions.,

,Editions,[,edit,],
,DNN Platform (formerly ""DotNetNuke Community Edition"" ,content management system,) is open source software that is intended to allow management of websites without much technical knowledge, and to be extensible through a large number of third-party apps to provide functionality not included in the ,DNN core modules,. ,Skins, can be used to change the look of a website using DNN.,
,There are two commercial editions of the software with increased functionality compared to DNN Platform, and technical support. The DotNetNuke ,Professional Edition, was introduced in February 2009 with version 4.9. In July 2013, DotNetNuke Professional Edition was renamed Evoq Content.,[7], In addition, DotNetNuke Enterprise Edition was renamed Evoq Content: Enterprise.,[8], Evoq version 9.0 was released in December 2016.,[9],
,Architecture,[,edit,],
,
,
,
,
DNN uses a three-tier architecture model.,
,
,
,DotNetNuke uses a three-tier architecture model with a core framework providing support to the extensible modular structure.,
,While traditionally DNN focused on providing server side functionality, recent projects strive to enhance client side experiences - along with the rest of the industry.,[10], In recent years DNN migrated from using exclusively ,Web Forms, to also allowing ,Model View Controller, and ,Single-page application, architectures.,[11], In the future, DNN faces the challenge of moving from ,ASP.NET, 4.6 to the cross-platform free and open source ,.NET Core,.,
,DNN can be extended using 3rd-party modules and providers that add functionality at the server or client side. The appearance of individual pages and sites can be customized using skins.,[12],
,Modules,[,edit,],
,
,
,
,
DotNetNuke modules.,
,
,
,The default functionality of DNN can be expanded by adding third-party modules, either from an existing module store,,[13], from 3rd party authors,,[14], or through ,in-house development, of custom functionality.,[15], The DNN framework provides basic functionality such as ,security,, user administration, and ,content management,, while modules are used to tailor the web site for specific deployment needs.,[16],
,A set of primary modules are included with the core DNN distribution. These modules provide the functionality required to create an e-commerce system, an intranet, a public web site or a custom web application. They are maintained by a volunteer team community. In 2015 and 2016 most projects were moved from the DotNetNuke Community Forge,[17], to GitHub.,[18],
,Web pages have skins which define regions of a page (plus their appearance) where page editors can place modules (or extensions) made available by site administrators. Pages and modules can inherit or set custom access permissions that define which groups of users can view or edit each item.,
,Module can be created in various ways: compiled modules use the Web Application Project model and are written in C# or VB.NET,,[19], dynamic modules use the Web Site Project model, and ,Razor, modules which use a C# or VB.NET scripting language.,[20],
,Skins,[,edit,],
,A skinning architecture provides a ,separation of presentation and content,, enabling a web designer to develop skins without requiring any specialist knowledge of development in ASP.NET: only knowledge of ,HTML, and an understanding of how to prepare and package the skins themselves is required. Skins consist of basic HTML files with placeholders (,tokens,) for content, menus and other functionality, along with support files such as images, ,style sheets, and ,JavaScript,, packaged in a ,ZIP file,.,[21],
,Upon Microsoft's release of the ,.NET Framework version 2,, Microsoft had included functionality known as master pages. The principal idea behind master pages was to encourage ,code recycling, and consistent design and aesthetics throughout a site by creating a master page with placeholders, which at ,runtime, would be ,compiled, and replaced by content.,
,Like modules, skins, can be uploaded and automatically installed through the administration pages. If the compiled skin does not contain an ASP.NET user control file, then the DNN skinning engine builds one based on various tokens included in the HTML file which refer to various sections, placeholders and/or modules of a DNN-produced page. Modern skins incorporate CSS3 and HTML5,[22], with many authors' skins supporting ,Responsive web design,, various ,JavaScript libraries,. With no credentialing, a skin's quality may vary, but often trial periods are available to evaluate functionality.,
,Hosting,[,edit,],
,DNN 7.0 and above has a minimum requirement of Windows Vista, ,SQL Server, 2008, and ,.NET, 4.0 and ,IIS, 7+. These product's latest versions are supported.,[23], As of version 6.0, DNN can also be installed in an ,Azure, ,cloud computing, environment.,[24], Numerous web hosting companies offer DNN as an offering, and a 1 step installation process is available through Microsoft.,[25], However DNN's requirement for an IIS medium trust environment has prevented broader adoption,[26], among some mainstream hosting companies.,
,Developer ecosystem community,[,edit,],
,DNNSoftware.com has over 1 million registered members as of November 2013 and is used on some 750,000 websites globally.,[27], Support for the Community Edition of DotNetNuke is provided by community members and developers can participate in the open-source project on GitHub.,[28],
,API, reference documents for modules,[29], and skins,[30], are available, although as of 2013, some documentation was still available only in task-oriented form.,[31], A Wiki has been created to address this weakness, with 400 wiki pages as of May 2014.,[32],
,Project history,[,edit,],
,The DotNetNuke application originally evolved out of another project, the IBuySpy Workshop.,[33], The IBuySpy Workshop application had been created by Shaun Walker ,[34], as an enhancement to the IBuySpy Portal that started as a sample application for the ,.NET Framework,. Early versions of DotNetNuke were released by Walker's company, Perpetual Motion Inc, while later development was expanded by the open source community.,[,citation needed,],
,The name DotNetNuke was coined by Walker by combining the term ,.NET, with the word ""nuke"", which had been popular with pre-existing frameworks such as ,PHP-Nuke, and PostNuke.,[35], The term DotNetNuke and DNN are registered trademarks in the US (Search USPTO,[36],) and Canada.,[37],[38],
,In September 2006, four members of the project's board of directors formed a corporation to oversee the development of the project. The new DotNetNuke Corporation was co-founded by Walker,,[39], Joe Brinkman,,[40], Nik Kalyani,,[41], and Scott Willhite,[42], and replaced Perpetual Motion Interactive Systems Inc. as the corporate entity behind the project.,[43],
,On November 25, 2008, DotNetNuke announced ,Series A, financing from Sierra Ventures and ,August Capital,, and in February 2009, after hiring Navin Nagiah as CEO, a Professional Edition version of DotNetNuke has been released for business and enterprise customers. In February 2010 DotNetNuke announced a Series B financing from Sierra Ventures, ,August Capital,, and Pelion Venture Partners.,[44],
,In August 2009 a partner program was launched by DotNetNuke Corporation, aimed at providing support to the web design and development companies that build web sites using DotNetNuke. DotNetNuke Corporation also announced the acquisition of Snowcovered, an online market for DotNetNuke modules, skins, services and related products.,[45],
,In October 2009, the 2009 Open Source CMS Market Share Report concluded that DotNetNuke was the leading .NET-based open source web content management system.,[46],
,In 2013, the company was renamed to ,DNN Corporation,.,[47],

,Django, (,/,ˈ,dʒ,æ,ŋ,ɡ,oʊ,/, ,JANG,-goh,),[5], is a ,free and open-source, ,web framework,, written in ,Python,, which follows the model-view-template (MVT) ,architectural pattern,.,[6],[7], It is maintained by the ,Django Software Foundation, (DSF), an independent organization established as a ,501(c)(3), non-profit.,
,Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes ,reusability, and ""pluggability"" of components, rapid development, and the principle of ,don't repeat yourself,. Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative ,create, read, update and delete, interface that is generated dynamically through ,introspection, and configured via admin models.,
,Some well-known sites that use Django include the ,Public Broadcasting Service,,,[8], ,Instagram,,,[9], ,Mozilla,,,[10], ,The Washington Times,,,[11], ,Disqus,,,[12], ,Bitbucket,,,[13], and ,Nextdoor,.,[14], It was used on ,Pinterest,,,[15], but later the site moved to a framework built over ,Flask,.,[16],

,History,[,edit,],
,Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the ,web programmers, at the ,Lawrence Journal-World, newspaper, ,Adrian Holovaty, and ,Simon Willison,, began using Python to build applications.,[17], It was released publicly under a ,BSD license, in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist ,Django Reinhardt,.,[17],
,In June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed ,Django Software Foundation, (DSF) would maintain Django in the future.,[18],

,
,Despite having its own nomenclature, such as naming the callable objects generating the ,HTTP, responses ""views"",,[6], the core Django framework can be seen as an ,MVC, architecture.,[7], It consists of an ,object-relational mapper, (ORM) that mediates between ,data models, (defined as Python classes) and a ,relational database, ("",M,odel""), a system for processing HTTP requests with a ,web templating system, ("",V,iew""), and a ,regular-expression,-based ,URL, dispatcher ("",C,ontroller"").,
,Also included in the core framework are:,
,
,a lightweight and standalone web server for development and testing,
,a form serialization and validation system that can translate between ,HTML, forms and values suitable for storage in the database,
,a template system that utilizes the concept of ,inheritance, borrowed from object-oriented programming,
,a ,caching, framework that can use any of several cache methods,
,support for ,middleware, classes that can intervene at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functions,
,an internal dispatcher system that allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signals,
,an ,internationalization, system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languages,
,a ,serialization, system that can produce and read ,XML, and/or ,JSON, representations of Django model instances,
,a system for extending the capabilities of the template engine,
,an interface to Python's built-in ,unit test, framework,
,
,Bundled applications,[,edit,],
,The main Django distribution also bundles a number of applications in its ""contrib"" package, including:,
,
,an extensible authentication system,
,the dynamic administrative interface,
,tools for generating ,RSS, and ,Atom, syndication feeds,
,a site's framework that allows one Django installation to run multiple websites, each with their own content and applications,
,tools for generating ,Google Sitemaps,
,built-in mitigation for ,cross-site request forgery,, ,cross-site scripting,, ,SQL injection,, ,password cracking, and other typical web attacks, most of them turned on by default,[19],[20],
,a framework for creating ,GIS, applications,
,
,Extensibility,[,edit,],

,Django's configuration system allows third party code to be plugged into a regular project, provided that it follows the reusable app,[21], conventions. More than 2500 packages,[22], are available to extend the framework's original behavior, providing solutions to issues the original tool didn't tackle: registration, search, ,API, provision and consumption, ,CMS,, etc.,
,This extensibility is, however, mitigated by internal components dependencies. While the Django philosophy implies loose coupling,,[23], the template filters and tags assume one engine implementation, and both the auth and admin bundled applications require the use of the internal ,ORM,. None of these filters or bundled apps are mandatory to run a Django project, but reusable apps tend to depend on them, encouraging developers to keep using the official stack in order to benefit fully from the apps ecosystem.,
,Server arrangements,[,edit,],
,Django can be run in conjunction with ,Apache,, ,Nginx, using ,WSGI,, ,Gunicorn,, or ,Cherokee, using flup (a Python module).,[24],[25], Django also includes the ability to launch a ,FastCGI, server, enabling use behind any web server which supports FastCGI, such as ,Lighttpd, or ,Hiawatha,. It is also possible to use other ,WSGI,-compliant web servers.,[26], Django officially supports four database backends: ,PostgreSQL,, ,MySQL,, ,SQLite,, and ,Oracle,. ,Microsoft SQL Server, can be used with django-mssql on ,Microsoft, ,operating systems,,,[27], while similarly external backends exist for ,IBM Db2,,,[28], ,SQL Anywhere,[29], and ,Firebird,.,[30], There is a ,fork, named django-nonrel, which supports ,NoSQL, databases, such as ,MongoDB, and ,Google App Engine,'s Datastore.,[31],
,Django may also be run in conjunction with ,Jython, on any ,Java EE, application server such as ,GlassFish, or ,JBoss,. In this case django-jython must be installed in order to provide ,JDBC, drivers for database connectivity, which also can provide functionality to compile Django in to a .war suitable for deployment.,[32],
,Google App Engine, includes support for Django version 1.x.x,[33], as one of the bundled frameworks.,
,Version history,[,edit,],
,The Django team will occasionally designate certain releases to be “Long-term support” (LTS) releases.,[34], LTS releases will get security and data loss fixes applied for a guaranteed period of time, typically 3+ years, regardless of the pace of releases afterwards.,

,Development tools with Django support,[,edit,],
,For developing a Django project, no special tools are necessary, since the source code can be edited with any conventional ,text editor,. Nevertheless, editors specialized on ,computer programming, can help increase the productivity of development, e.g. with features such as ,syntax highlighting,. Since Django is written in Python, text editors which are aware of Python syntax are beneficial in this regard.,
,Integrated development environments, (IDE) add further functionality, such as debugging, refactoring, unit testing, etc. As with plain editors, IDEs with support for Python can be beneficial. Some IDEs that are specialized on Python additionally have integrated support for Django projects, so that using such an IDE when developing a Django project can help further increase productivity. For comparison of such Python IDEs, see the main article:,
,Main article: ,Comparison of integrated development environments § Python,
,Community,[,edit,],
,There is a semiannual conference for Django developers and users, named ""DjangoCon"", that has been held since September 2008. DjangoCon is held annually in Europe, in May or June;,[54], while another is held in the United States in August or September, in various cities.,[55], The 2012 DjangoCon took place in Washington D.C. from 3 to 8 September. 2013 DjangoCon was held in Chicago at the Hyatt Regency Hotel and the post-conference ,Sprints, were hosted at Digital Bootcamp, computer training center.,[56], The 2014 DjangoCon US returned to Portland, OR from 30 August to 6 September. The 2015 DjangoCon US was held in Austin, TX from 6 to 11 September at the AT&T Executive Center. The 2016 DjangoCon US was held in Philadelphia, PA at The ,Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, from 17 to 22 July.,[57],
,Django mini-conferences were held in ,Hobart,, Australia in July 2013, in ,Brisbane,, Australia in August 2014 and 2015, and in ,Melbourne,, Australia in 2016.,[58],
,Ports to other languages,[,edit,],
,Programmers have ported Django's template design from Python to other languages, providing decent cross-platform support. Some of these options are more direct ports; others, though inspired by Django and retaining its concepts, take the liberty to deviate from Django's design:,
,
,Liquid for ,Ruby,[59],
,Template::Swig for ,Perl,[60],
,Twig for ,PHP,[61],
,Jinja for ,Python,[62],
,ErlyDTL for ,Erlang,[63],

,Biography,[,edit,],
,Formation of Gentoo Linux distribution,[,edit,],
,During his time as a system administrator at the ,University of New Mexico, in ,Albuquerque, Robbins formed his own distribution ,Enoch Linux,, which was later renamed ,Gentoo, in 2002.,
,However, like many other ,free software, projects, Gentoo struggled to create a ,business model, which would support its key developers.,[1], Robbins resigned as Chief Architect on 26 April 2004,,[2], citing considerable ,personal debt,,,[3], and a desire to spend more time with his family, formed the ,Gentoo Foundation, and transferred all Gentoo ,intellectual property, to it, so that Gentoo is now run as a full community-based model. He did rejoin the project for a short time from August 2006,,[4],[5], becoming a developer again in February 2007 and joining the amd64 team,[6], but resigned in early March 2007.,[7],
,There have been several high-profile criticisms,[8],[9], of the way Gentoo has run since Robbins left, such as: ""...since the resignation of Gentoo's founder and benevolent dictator from the project in 2004, the newly established Gentoo Foundation has been battling with lack of clear directions and frequent developer conflicts..."",,[10], but in mid-July 2007 it emerged that Robbins was still technically the legal president of the Gentoo Foundation:,[11],[12],
,
,...I would like to see more fun in Gentoo, and a lot less politics, and in my apparent role as President of the Gentoo Foundation, I may have an opportunity to change things for the better. I will need to look into this more...,[11],
,
,Funtoo Linux,[,edit,],
,In 2008, Robbins began to work on ,Funtoo,, a project created to allow him to work on extending the technologies originally created for Gentoo.,[13],
,Microsoft,[,edit,],
,Robbins' move to ,Microsoft,, in May 2005, attracted attention,[14],[15], within the Linux community, which has historically had a combative relationship with Microsoft. He described his role working for ,Bill Hilf, as ""...helping Microsoft to understand Open Source and community-based projects..."",[16],
,However, Robbins resigned less than a year later on 16 January 2006 due to frustrations that he was unable to fully utilize his technical skills in this position.,
,RTLinux,[,edit,],
,Later in 2006, he joined ,FSMLabs, in Socorro, New Mexico, to work on ,RTLinux,.,
,Funtoo Technologies,[,edit,],
,Daniel Robbins is also president of ,Funtoo Technologies,, a consulting firm founded in 2006 and located in ,Albuquerque, New Mexico,.,

,OpenBSD, is a ,free and open-source, ,Unix-like, computer ,operating system, descended from ,Berkeley Software Distribution, (BSD), a ,Research Unix, derivative developed at the ,University of California, Berkeley,. In late 1995, ,Theo de Raadt, ,forked, it from ,NetBSD,. Besides the operating system as a whole, the project maintains portable versions of many subsystems, most notably ,OpenSSH,, which are available as packages in other operating systems.,
,The project is known for its developers' insistence on ,open-source, code, good documentation, code correctness, and security. It has strict policies on ,licensing,, preferring the ,ISC license, and other variants of the ,Simplified BSD License,. Many of its ,security features, are optional or absent in other operating systems. Its developers frequently ,audit, the ,source tree, for software bugs and security holes.,
,De Raadt coordinates the project from his home in ,Calgary,, Alberta, Canada. Its logo and mascot is a ,pufferfish, named Puffy.,

,
,
,In December 1994, NetBSD co-founder ,Theo de Raadt, was asked to resign from his position as a senior developer and member of the NetBSD core team.,[6], The reason for this is not wholly clear, although there are claims that it was due to personality clashes within the NetBSD project and on its mailing lists.,[6],
,In October 1995, de Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project forked from NetBSD 1.0. The initial release, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed by OpenBSD 2.0 in October of the same year.,[7], Since then, the project has followed a schedule of a release every six months, each of which is supported for one year.,
,On 25 July 2007, OpenBSD developer Bob Beck announced the formation of the ,OpenBSD Foundation,, a Canadian non-profit organization formed to ""act as a single point of contact for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support OpenBSD."",[8],
,Just how widely OpenBSD is used is hard to determine as its developers do not publish or collect usage statistics. In September 2005, the BSD Certification Group performed a usage survey which revealed that 32.8% of BSD users (1420 of 4330 respondents) were using OpenBSD,,[5], placing it second out of the four major BSD variants, behind ,FreeBSD, with 77% and ahead of NetBSD with 16.3%.,[n 1],

,Security,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD's security enhancements,, built-in cryptography, and the pf ,packet filter, suit it for use in the security industry, such as on firewalls,,[9], ,intrusion-detection systems,, and ,VPN, ,gateways,.,
,Proprietary, systems from several manufacturers are based on OpenBSD, including devices from ,Armorlogic, (Profense web application firewall), Calyptix Security,,[10], GeNUA,,[11], RTMX,,[12], and .vantronix.,[13], Later versions of ,Microsoft,'s ,Services for UNIX,, an extension to the ,Windows, operating system providing ,Unix,-like functionality, use large amounts of OpenBSD code.,[14],
,Desktop,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD ships with the ,X Window System,[15], and is suitable for use on the desktop.,[16],[17],:,xl, There are a huge number of packages totalling 7814,[18], in number. Packages are available for popular applications, including desktop environments such as ,GNOME,, ,KDE,, and ,Xfce,, and web browsers such as ,Firefox, and ,Chromium,.,[19], The project also includes three window managers in the main distribution: ,cwm,, ,FVWM,, and ,twm,.,[20],
,Server,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD features a full server suite and can be easily configured as a ,mail server,, ,web server,, ,FTP server,, ,DNS server,, ,router,, ,firewall,, ,NFS, ,file server,, or any combination of these.,
,Component projects,[,edit,],
,Despite the small team size and relatively low usage of OpenBSD, the project maintains portable versions of many parts of the base system, including:,
,
,LibreSSL,, a free implementation of the ,Secure Sockets Layer, (SSL) and ,Transport Layer Security, (TLS) protocols, forked from the ,OpenSSL, 1.0.1g branch,
,OpenBGPD,, a free implementation of the ,Border Gateway Protocol, 4 (BGP-4),
,OpenOSPFD,, a free implementation of the ,Open Shortest Path First, (OSPF) routing protocol,
,OpenNTPD,, a simple alternative to ntp.org's ,Network Time Protocol, (NTP) daemon,
,OpenSMTPD,, a free ,Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, (SMTP) daemon with ,IPv4,/,IPv6,, ,PAM,, ,Maildir, and virtual domains support,
,httpd, an ,HTTP, server first included in the 5.6 release,
,OpenSSH,, a free implementation of the ,Secure Shell, (SSH) protocol,
,OpenIKED,, a free implementation of the ,Internet Key Exchange, (IKEv2) protocol,
,Common Address Redundancy Protocol, (CARP), a free alternative to ,Cisco,'s patented ,HSRP,/,VRRP, server redundancy protocols,
,PF,, an ,IPv4,/,IPv6, stateful firewall with ,NAT,, ,PAT,, ,QoS, and traffic normalization support,
,pfsync,, a firewall states synchronization protocol for ,PF firewall, with ,High Availability, support using ,CARP,
,spamd,, a spam filter with ,greylisting, support designed to inter-operate with the ,PF firewall,
,sndio,, a compact audio and MIDI framework,
,Xenocara,, a customized ,X.Org, build infrastructure,
,cwm,, a stacking window manager,
,tmux, virtual console multiplexer,
,
,Some subsystems have been integrated into the base system of several other BSD projects,,[21],[22],[23], while many are available as packages for use in other Unix-like systems.,[24],[25],[26],
,Third-party components in the base system,[,edit,],
,OpenBSD includes a number of ,third-party software components,, many with OpenBSD-specific patches;,[19], examples include the ,X.Org Server,, ,GNU Compiler Collection,[27], (which acts as the default ,compiler,),,[n 2], ,Perl,, ,NSD,, ,Unbound,, ,Ncurses,, ,GNU Binutils,, ,GNU Debugger, and ,Awk,.,
,OpenBSD used to include a fork of ,Apache 1.3,, which was later replaced by ,Nginx,. In the 5.6 release, Nginx was replaced with ,httpd,, an ,HTTP server, with ,FastCGI, and ,Transport Layer Security, support.,[28], As of May 2016,[update],, Apache and Nginx are still available as ports.,[29],[30],
,Development and release process,[,edit,],
,
,
,
,
OpenBSD developers at c2k1 ,hackathon, at ,MIT,
,
,
,Development is continuous, and team management is open and tiered. Anyone with appropriate skills may contribute, with commit rights being awarded on merit and de Raadt acting as coordinator.,[17],:,xxxv, Two official releases are made per year, with the version number incremented by 0.1,,[31], and these are each supported for twelve months (two release cycles).,[32], Snapshot releases are also available at frequent intervals.,
,Maintenance patches for supported releases may be applied manually or by updating the system against the patch branch of the ,CVS, repository for that release.,[33], Alternatively, a system administrator may opt to upgrade using a snapshot release and then regularly update the system against the ,-current, branch of the CVS repository, in order to gain pre-release access to recently added features.,
,The standard OpenBSD kernel, as maintained by the project, is strongly recommended for end users; this is as opposed to kernels customized by the user.,[34],
,Packages outside the base system are maintained by CVS through a ,ports tree, and are the responsibility of the individual maintainers, known as porters. As well as keeping the current branch up to date, porters are expected to apply appropriate bug-fixes and maintenance fixes to branches of their package for OpenBSD's supported releases. Ports are generally not subject to the same continuous auditing as the base system due to lack of manpower.,
,Binary packages are built centrally from the ports tree for each architecture. This process is applied for the current version, for each supported release, and for each snapshot. Administrators are recommended to use the package mechanism rather than build the package from the ports tree, unless they need to perform their own source changes.,
,OpenBSD's developers regularly meet at special events called ,hackathons,,,[35], where they ""sit down and code"", emphasizing productivity.,[36],
,Every new release includes a song.,[37],
,The ,OpenBSD Foundation, was accepted as a mentoring organization for the 2014 Google Summer of Code.,[38],[39],
,Open-source and open documentation,[,edit,],
,The OpenBSD Project is noted for its high-quality user documentation, considered top among the BSD family operating systems, all of which have excellent documentation.,[40],[41], When OpenBSD was created, de Raadt decided that the source should be easily available for anyone to read at any time, so, with the assistance of Chuck Cranor,,[42], he set up the first public, anonymous ,CVS, server. At the time, the tradition was for only a small team of developers to have access to a project's source repository.,[43], Cranor and de Raadt concluded that this practice ""runs counter to the open source philosophy"" and is inconvenient to contributors. De Raadt's decision allowed ""users to take a more active role"", and signaled the project's belief in open and public access to source code.,[43],
,OpenBSD does not include ,closed source, binary drivers in the source tree, nor do they include code requiring the signing of ,non-disclosure agreements,.,[44],
,Since OpenBSD is based in Canada, no United States export restrictions on cryptography apply, allowing the distribution to make full use of modern algorithms for encryption. For example, the swap space is divided into small sections and each section is encrypted with its own key, ensuring that sensitive data does not leak into an insecure part of the system.,[9],
,OpenBSD randomizes various behaviors of applications, making them less predictable and thus more difficult to attack. For example, PIDs are created and associated randomly to processes; the ,bind, ,system call, uses random ,port numbers,; files are created with random ,inode, numbers; and IP datagrams have random identifiers.,[45], This approach also helps expose bugs in the kernel and in user space programs.,
,The OpenBSD policy on openness extends to hardware documentation: in the slides for a December 2006 presentation, de Raadt explained that without it ""developers often make mistakes writing drivers"", and pointed out that ""the [oh my god, I got it to work] rush is harder to achieve, and some developers just give up."",[46], He went on to say that vendor-supplied binary drivers are unacceptable for inclusion in OpenBSD, that they have ""no trust of vendor binaries running in our kernel"" and that there is ""no way to fix [them] ... when they break."",[46],
,Licensing,[,edit,],
,See also: ,BSD and GPL licensing,
,A goal of the OpenBSD Project is to ""maintain the spirit of the original Berkeley Unix ,copyrights,"", which permitted a ""relatively un-encumbered Unix source distribution."",[47], To this end, the ,Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) license, is preferred for new code, but the ,MIT, and BSD licenses are also accepted. The widely used ,GNU General Public License, is considered overly restrictive compared to these.,[48],
,In June 2001, triggered by concerns over Darren Reed's modification of IPFilter's license wording, a systematic license audit of the OpenBSD ports and source trees was undertaken.,[49], Code in more than a hundred files throughout the system was found to be unlicensed, ambiguously licensed or in use against the terms of the license. To ensure that all licenses were properly adhered to, an attempt was made to contact all the relevant copyright holders: some pieces of code were removed, many were replaced, and others, such as the ,multicast, ,routing, tools ,mrinfo, and ,map-mbone,, were ,relicensed, so that OpenBSD could continue to use them.,[50],[51], Also removed during this audit was all software produced by ,Daniel J. Bernstein,. At the time, Bernstein requested that all modified versions of his code be approved by him prior to redistribution, a requirement to which OpenBSD developers were unwilling to devote time or effort.,[52],[53],[54],
,Because of licensing concerns, the OpenBSD team has re-implemented software from scratch or adopted suitable existing software. Of particular note is the development, after license restrictions were imposed on ,IPFilter,, of the ,pf, ,packet filter,, which first appeared in OpenBSD 3.0,[55], and is now available in other major BSDs.,[56], OpenBSD developers have also replaced GPL licensed tools (such as ,diff,, ,grep, and ,pkg-config,) with BSD licensed equivalents.,[,citation needed,],
,Funding,[,edit,],
,Although the operating system and its portable components are used in commercial products, de Raadt says that little of the funding for the project comes from the industry: ""traditionally all our funding has come from user donations and users buying our CDs (our other products don't really make us much money). Obviously, that has not been a lot of money."",[31],
,For a two-year period in the early 2000s, the project received ,DARPA, funding, which ""paid the salaries of 5 people to work completely full-time, bought about $30k in hardware, and paid for 3 hackathons"", from the ,POSSE project,.,[31],
,In 2006, de Raadt expressed concern about the asymmetry of funding: ""I think that contributions should have come first from the vendors, secondly from the corporate users, and thirdly from individual users. But the response has been almost entirely the opposite, with almost a 15 to 1 dollar ratio in favor of the little people. Thanks a lot, little people!"",[31], However, since 2014 several large contributions to the ,OpenBSD Foundation, have come from corporations such as Microsoft,,[57], Facebook, and Google as well as the ,Core Infrastructure Initiative,.,[58],
,In 2006, the OpenBSD Project experienced financial danger.,[59], The ,Mozilla Foundation,[60], and ,GoDaddy,[61], are among the organizations that helped the OpenBSD Project to overcome its financial troubles.,
,On 14 January 2014, Bob Beck issued a request for funding to cover electrical costs. If sustainable funding was not found, Beck suggested the OpenBSD Project would shut down.,[62], The project soon received a US$20,000 donation from Mircea Popescu, the Romanian creator of the MPEx bitcoin stock exchange, paid in ,bitcoins,.,[63], The project raised US$150,000,[64], in response to the appeal, enabling it to pay its bills and securing its short-term future.,[63],
,Security and code auditing,[,edit,],
,For more details on this topic, see ,OpenBSD security features,.,
,Shortly after OpenBSD's creation, de Raadt was contacted by a local security software company named Secure Networks (SNI).,[65],[66], They were developing a ""network security auditing tool"" called Ballista,,[n 3], which was intended to find and attempt to ,exploit, possible software security flaws. This coincided with de Raadt's own interest in security, so for a time the two cooperated, a relationship that was of particular usefulness leading up to the release of OpenBSD 2.3,[67], and helped to define security as the focal point of the project.,[68],
,OpenBSD includes features designed to improve security, such as:,
,
,secure alternatives to ,POSIX, functions in the C standard library, such as ,strlcat, for ,strcat, and ,strlcpy, for ,strcpy,[69],
,toolchain alterations, including a ,static bounds checker,[27],
,memory protection techniques to guard against invalid accesses, such as ,ProPolice, and the ,W^X, ,page, protection feature,
,strong ,cryptography, and ,randomization,[70],
,
,To reduce the risk of a vulnerability or misconfiguration allowing ,privilege escalation,, many programs have been written or adapted to make use of ,privilege separation,, ,privilege revocation, and ,chrooting,. Privilege separation is a technique, pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the ,principle of least privilege,, where a program is split into two or more parts, one of which performs privileged operations and the other—almost always the bulk of the code—runs without privilege.,[71], Privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them. Chrooting involves restricting an application to one section of the ,file system,, prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system files. Developers have applied these features to OpenBSD versions of many common applications, such as ,tcpdump,, ,file,, ,tmux,, ,smtpd,, and ,syslogd,.,[72],
,OpenBSD developers were instrumental in the creation and development of ,OpenSSH,, which is developed in the OpenBSD CVS repositories. OpenSSH is based on the original ,SSH,.,[73], It first appeared in OpenBSD 2.6 and is now by far the most popular SSH client and server, available on many operating systems.,[74],
,The project has a policy of continually auditing source code for problems, work that developer Marc Espie has described as ""never finished ... more a question of process than of a specific bug being hunted."" He went on to list several typical steps once a bug is found, including examining the entire source tree for the same and similar issues, ""try[ing] to find out whether the documentation ought to be amended"", and investigating whether ""it's possible to augment the ,compiler, to warn against this specific problem."",[75],
,The default install is quite minimal, which the project states is to ensure novice users ""do not need to become security experts overnight"",,[76], which fits with open-source and code auditing practices argued to be important elements of a security system.,[77],
,Alleged FBI backdoor investigated,[,edit,],
,On 11 December 2010, Gregory Perry, a former technical consultant for the ,Federal Bureau of Investigation, (FBI), emailed de Raadt alleging that the FBI had paid some OpenBSD ex-developers 10 years previously to insert backdoors into the ,OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework,. De Raadt made the email public on 14 December by forwarding it to the openbsd-tech mailing list and suggested an audit of the ,IPsec, codebase.,[78],[79], De Raadt's response was skeptical of the report and he invited all developers to independently review the relevant code. In the weeks that followed, bugs were fixed but no evidence of backdoors were found.,[80], De Raadt stated ""I believe that NetSec was probably contracted to write backdoors as alleged. If those were written, I don't believe they made it into our tree. They might have been deployed as their own product."",[81],
,Slogan,[,edit,],
,The OpenBSD website features a prominent reference to the security record of the default installation. Until June 2002, the wording read ""Five years without a remote hole in the default install!"",[82], An ,OpenSSH, bug was then discovered that made it possible for a remote attacker to gain ,root privileges, in OpenBSD and in any of the other systems running OpenSSH at the time. It was quickly fixed, as is normal with known security holes.,[83],[84], The slogan was changed to ""One remote hole in the default install, in nearly 6 years!"" In 2007, a network-related remote vulnerability was found, which was also quickly fixed.,[85], The quote was subsequently altered to ""Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!"" As of May 2017,[update],, the wording remains.,
,Distribution and marketing,[,edit,],
,The name OpenBSD refers to the fact that OpenBSD's source code is freely available on the Internet. It also refers to the wide range of hardware platforms the operating system supports.,[86],
,OpenBSD is freely available in various ways: the source can be retrieved by anonymous ,CVS,,,[87], and binary releases and development snapshots can be downloaded by FTP, HTTP, and rsync.,[88], Prepackaged CD-ROM sets through version 6.0 can be ordered online for a small fee, complete with an assortment of stickers and a copy of the release's theme song. These, with their artwork and other bonuses, have been one of the project's few sources of income, funding hardware, Internet service, and other expenses.,[89], Beginning with version 6.1, CD-ROM sets are no longer released.,
,In common with other operating systems, OpenBSD provides a ,package management system, for easy installation and management of programs which are not part of the base operating system.,[90], Packages are binary files which are extracted, managed and removed using the package tools. On OpenBSD, the source of packages is the ports system, a collection of ,Makefiles, and other infrastructure required to create packages. In OpenBSD, the ports and base operating system are developed and released together for each version: this means that the ports or packages released with, for example, 4.6 are not suitable for use with 4.5 and vice versa.,[90],

Animated OpenBSD mascot ,Puffy,, 3D-rendered with ,Blender3D,
,
,
,OpenBSD at first used the ,BSD daemon, mascot. A specialized version of the daemon, the haloed daemon was drawn by Erick Green. Green was asked by de Raadt to create the logo for the 2.3 and 2.4 versions of OpenBSD. At first, it was planned to create a full daemon, including head and body, but Green was only able to complete the head part for OpenBSD 2.3. The body as well as pitchfork and tail was completed for OpenBSD 2.4.,[91], Subsequent releases saw variations, such as Cop daemon by Ty Semaka,,[92], but eventually settling on Puffy,,[93], described as a ,pufferfish,.,[n 4], Since then Puffy has appeared on OpenBSD promotional material and featured in release songs and artwork. The promotional material of early OpenBSD releases did not have a cohesive theme or design, but later the CD-ROMs, release songs, posters and tee-shirts for each release have been produced with a single style and theme, sometimes contributed to by Ty Semaka of the ,Plaid Tongued Devils,.,[37], These have become a part of OpenBSD ,advocacy,, with each release expounding a moral or political point important to the project, often through parody.,[94], Past themes have included: in OpenBSD 3.8, the ,Hackers of the Lost RAID,, a parody of ,Indiana Jones, linked to the new RAID tools featured as part of the release; ,The Wizard of OS,, making its debut in OpenBSD 3.7, based on the work of ,Pink Floyd, and a parody of ,The Wizard of Oz, related to the project's recent work on wireless card drivers; and OpenBSD 3.3's ,Puff the Barbarian,, including an 80s rock-style song and parody of ,Conan the Barbarian,, alluding to open documentation.,[37],

,Life and career,[,edit,],
,Holovaty, a ,Ukrainian American,, grew up in ,Naperville, Illinois,. He graduated from the ,Missouri School of Journalism, in 2001 and worked as a web developer/journalist for ,The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,, ,Lawrence Journal-World, and ,The Washington Post, before starting ,EveryBlock,, a web startup that provided ""microlocal"" news, in 2007.,[1],
,While working at the ,Lawrence Journal-World, from 2002 to 2005, he and other web developers (,Simon Willison,, Jacob Kaplan-Moss and Wilson Miner,[2],) created ,Django,, an ,open source, ,web application framework, for ,Python,. He and Kaplan-Moss served as the framework's ,Benevolent Dictators for Life, until January 2014.,[3], The pair wrote ,The Django Book,, first published in 2007.,
,Holovaty is also a guitarist. In 1999, he recorded an album of his own guitar compositions,,[4], and since 2007 he has posted videos of his acoustic guitar arrangements on ,YouTube,, building an audience of more than 20,000 subscribers.,[5], In 2012 he and PJ Macklin founded ,SoundSlice,, a ,collaboratively edited, website which shows YouTube music videos alongside simultaneous animated ,tablature,, intended to help guitarists learn new musical pieces.,[6],
,Crime mapping innovations,[,edit,],
,In 2005, Holovaty launched ,chicagocrime.org,, a ,Google Maps, ,mashup, of ,Chicago Police Department, crime data.,[7], The site won the 2005 Batten Award for Innovations in Journalism,[8], and was named by ,The New York Times, as one of 2005's best ideas.,[9],
,As one of the first Google Maps mashups, it helped influence Google to create its official Google Maps API.,[10], Newspaper sites such as the ,Chicago Tribune, and the ,Chicago Sun-Times, have incorporated a map from EveryBlock, the successor to chicagocrime.org, into their web sites.,[11],
,In 2007, Holovaty was awarded a $1.1 million ,Knight Foundation, grant and left his job as editor of editorial innovations at ,washingtonpost.com, to start EveryBlock, the successor to chicagocrime.org.,[12], On August 17, 2009 EveryBlock was officially acquired by ,msnbc.com,.,[13], The terms of the deal were not disclosed.,[14], In February 2013, NBC News announced that it was shutting down EveryBlock.,[15],

,Drupal, ,/,ˈ,d,r,uː,p,əl,/, is ,[4], a ,free, and ,open source, ,content-management framework, written in ,PHP, and distributed under the ,GNU General Public License,.,[3],[5],[6], Drupal provides a ,back-end, framework for at least 2.3% of all ,web sites, worldwide,[7],[8], – ranging from personal ,blogs, to corporate, political, and government sites.,[9], Systems also use Drupal for ,knowledge management, and for business collaboration.,[10],
,As of November 2017,[update],, the Drupal community is composed of more than 1.3 million members,,[11],[12], including 109,000 users actively contributing,,[13], resulting in more than 39,000 free modules that extend and customize Drupal functionality,,[14], over 2,500 free themes that change the look and feel of Drupal,,[15], and at least 1,180 free distributions that allow users to quickly and easily set up a complex, use-specific Drupal in fewer steps.,[16],
,The standard release of Drupal, known as ,Drupal core,, contains basic features common to ,content-management systems,. These include user account registration and maintenance, menu management, ,RSS, feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple Web site, a single- or multi-user blog, an ,Internet forum,, or a community Web site providing for ,user-generated content,.,
,Drupal also describes itself as a ,Web application framework,.,[17], When compared with notable frameworks Drupal meets most of the generally accepted ,feature requirements, for such web frameworks.,[18],[19],[20],
,Although Drupal offers a sophisticated ,API, for developers, basic Web-site installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills.,[21],
,Drupal runs on any ,computing platform, that supports both a ,Web server, capable of running PHP and a ,database, to store content and configuration.,

Drupal version 1-6 release history timeline,
,
,
,Originally written by ,Dries Buytaert, as a ,message board,, Drupal became an ,open source, project in 2001.,[25], The name ,Drupal, represents an English rendering of the ,Dutch, word ,druppel,, which means ""drop"" (as in a water droplet).,[26], The name came from the now-defunct Drop.org Web site, whose code slowly evolved into Drupal. Buytaert wanted to call the site ""dorp"" (Dutch for ""village"") for its community aspects, but mistyped it when checking the domain name and thought the error sounded better.,[25],
,Interest in Drupal got a significant boost in 2003 when it helped build ""DeanSpace"" for ,Howard Dean,, one of the candidates in the ,U.S. Democratic Party,'s primary campaign for the ,2004 U.S. presidential election,. DeanSpace used open-source sharing of Drupal to support a decentralized network of approximately 50 disparate, unofficial pro-Dean websites that allowed users to communicate directly with one another as well as with the campaign.,[27], After Dean ended his campaign, members of his Web team continued to pursue their interest in developing a Web platform that could aid political activism by launching CivicSpace Labs in July 2004, ""...the first company with full-time employees that was developing and distributing Drupal technology."",[28], Other companies began to also specialize in Drupal development.,[29],[30], By 2013 the Drupal Web site listed hundreds of vendors that offered Drupal-related services.,[31],
,As of 2014,[update], Drupal is developed by a community,,[32], and its popularity is growing rapidly.,[,citation needed,], From July 2007 to June 2008 the Drupal.org site provided more than 1.4 million downloads of Drupal software, an increase of approximately 125% from the previous year.,[33],[34],
,As of January 2017,[update], more than 1,180,000 sites use Drupal.,[35], These include hundreds of well-known organizations,,[36], including corporations, media and publishing companies, governments, non-profits,,[37], schools, and individuals. Drupal has won several ,Packt, Open Source CMS Awards,[38], and won the ,Webware 100, ,[,clarification needed,], three times in a row.,[39],[40],
,On March 5, 2009 Buytaert announced a ,code freeze, for Drupal 7 for September 1, 2009.,[41], Drupal 7 was released on January 5, 2011, with release parties in several countries.,[42], After that, maintenance on Drupal 5 stopped, with only Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 maintained.,[43], Drupal 7 series maintenance updates are released regularly.,[44],
,On December 1, 2012, Drupal 8 started its feature completion.,[45], About three years later, on October 7, 2015 Drupal 8 first release candidate (rc1) was announced.,[46], Drupal 8 includes new features and improvements for both users and developers, including: a revamped user interface; WYSIWYG and in-place editing; improved mobile support; added and improved key contributed modules including Views, Date, and Entity Reference; introduced a new object-oriented backend leveraging Symfony components; revamped configuration management; and improved multilingual support. Drupal 8 rc1 is the collective work of over 3,200 core contributors.,[47],
,Drupal 8.0.0 was released on November 19, 2015.,[48], A subsequent upgrade to it is also available in the form of Drupal 8.1.0,[49], that brings numerous improvements, including CKEditor WYSIWYG enhancements, added APIs, an improved help page, and two new experimental modules. Experimental modules are meant for testing purposes, but are not yet fully supported.,
,Core,[,edit,],
,In the Drupal community, ""core"" refers to the collaboratively built codebase that can be extended through contributory modules and for versions prior to Drupal 8 is kept outside of the ""sites"" folder of a Drupal installation.,[50], (Starting with version 8, core is kept in its own 'core' sub-directory.) Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Bootstrap and Common libraries are defined as Drupal core and all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.,
,In a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some ,Symfony, libraries into Drupal core.,
,Core modules also includes a hierarchical ,taxonomy, system, which lets developers categorize content or ,tagged, with key words for easier access.,[21],
,Drupal maintains a detailed ,changelog, of core feature updates by version.,[51],
,Core modules,[,edit,],
,Drupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.,[52],
,The core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:,[52],
,
,
,Access statistics and logging,
,Advanced search,
,Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls,
,Caching and feature throttling for improved performance,
,Descriptive URLs,
,Multi-level menu system,
,Multi-site support,[53],
,Multi-user content creation and editing,
,OpenID, support,
,RSS feed and feed aggregator,
,Security and new release update notification,
,User profiles,
,Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email),
,Workflow tools (triggers and actions),
,
,
,Core themes,[,edit,],
,Drupal includes core themes, which customize the ""look and feel"" of Drupal sites,,[54], for example, Garland and Bartik.,
,The Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.,[55],
,Localization,[,edit,],
,As of January 2017,[update],, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and ,English, (the default).,[56], Support is included for right-to-left languages such as ,Arabic,, ,Persian,, and ,Hebrew,.,[57],
,Drupal localization is built on top of ,gettext,, the GNU ,internationalization and localization, (i18n) library.,
,Auto-update notification,[,edit,],
,Drupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.,[57], It's important to update quickly after security updates are released.,
,Before updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or new updates is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replace by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.,
,On October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.,[58], Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.,[59], Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like drush is highly recommended.,
,Database abstraction,[,edit,],
,Prior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.,
,Drupal 7 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses ,PHP Data Objects, to abstract the database. ,Microsoft, has written a database driver for their ,SQL Server,.,[60], Drupal 7 supports the file-based SQLite database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.,
,Windows development,[,edit,],
,With Drupal 7's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server ,IIS,, it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.,
,A group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.,[61],
,Accessibility,[,edit,],
,With the release of Drupal 7, ,Web accessibility, has been greatly improved by the Drupal community.,[62], Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into the program code Core. The accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.,
,Drupal 7 started the adoption of ,WAI-ARIA, support for ,Rich Internet Applications, and this has been carried further in Drupal 8. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:,
,
,Drag and drop functionality,
,Improved color contrast and intensity,
,Adding skip navigation to core themes,
,Adding labels by default for input forms,
,Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus.,
,
,The community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.,[63],
,Extending the core,[,edit,],
,Drupal core is ,modular,, defining a system of ,hooks, and ,callbacks,, which are accessed internally via an ,API,.,[64], This design allows third-party contributed ,modules, and ,themes, to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.,
,Drupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.,[65], The Drupal community has the saying, ""Never hack core,"" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.,[50],
,Modules,[,edit,],
,Contributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, ,WYSIWYG, editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,,[66], integrating with BPM portals,,[67], and more. As of January 2017,[update], the Drupal website lists more than 36,500 free ,modules,.,[14],
,Some of the most commonly used contributed modules include:,[68],
,
,Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. ""Content type"" describes the kind of information. Content types include, but are not limited to, events, invitations, reviews, articles, and products. The CCK Fields API is in Drupal core in Drupal 7.,[69],[70],
,Views: facilitates the retrieval and presentation, through a database abstraction system, of content to site visitors. Basic views functionality has been added to core in Drupal 8.,[71],
,Panels: drag and drop layout manager that allows site administrators to visually design their site.,
,Rules: conditionally executed actions based on recurring events.,
,Features: enables the capture and management of features (entities, views, fields, configuration, etc.) into custom modules.,
,Context: allows definition of sections of site where Drupal features can be conditionally activated,
,Media: makes photo uploading and media management easier,
,Services: provides an API for Drupal.,
,Organic Groups Mailing List,
,
,Themes,[,edit,],
,As of January 2017,[update],, there are more than 2,400,[15], free community-contributed ,themes,. Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.,
,Drupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the ,PHPTemplate, engine,[72], or, to a lesser extent, the ,XTemplate, engine.,[73], Some templates use hard-coded ,PHP,. Drupal 8 will integrate the ,Twig, templating engine.,
,The inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.,[74], The Drupal theming system utilizes a ,template engine, to further separate ,HTML,/,CSS, from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.,
,Community-contributed themes,[75], at the Drupal website are released under a free ,GPL, license,,[76], and the most installed Drupal themes are ,listed on this page,.,[77],
,Distributions,[,edit,],
,In the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.,
,The distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.,[78], They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a ""brochure"" site rather than a news site or ,online store,.,
,Architecture,[,edit,],
,Drupal is based on the ,Presentation Abstraction Control, architecture, or PAC.,
,The ,menu system, acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source (,HTTP GET, and ,POST,), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).,
,It even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).,[79],
,Community,[,edit,],
,Drupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active ,community, support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,,[80], As of January 2017,[update], more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.,[13], The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.,[81], Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at ,Szeged, in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.,
,Smaller events, known as ""Drupal Camps"" or DrupalCamp,,[82], occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for ,Coding for a Cause, that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp (,Greater Los Angeles Drupal, Camp) event, ,Coders with a Cause,.,
,The Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called ,meetups, at a large number of venues around the world. In July, 2013, ,Droplabs,, a co-working space in Los Angeles, California, was recognized as the world's ""Top Drupal Location,[83],"" (with 62 recorded events) when compared with other event venues over a 12-month period.,
,There are a number of active Drupal forums,,[84], mailing lists,[85], and discussion groups.,[86], Drupal also maintains several ,IRC, channels,[87], on the ,Freenode, network.,
,There are over 30 national communities,[88], around drupal.org offering language-specific support.,
,Notable Drupal users include ,NBC,, ,Taboola,, and ,Patch,.,[89],
,Security,[,edit,],
,Drupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.,[90],[91],
,Administrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).,[92],
,Drupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories,,[93], a security team home page,,[94], and an RSS feed,[95], with the most recent security advisories.,
,In mid-October 2014,,[96], Drupal issued a ""highly critical"" security advisory regarding an ,SQL injection, bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.,[97],[98],
,Downloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any ,backdoor, installed by hackers if the site has already been ,compromised,.,[99], Attacks began soon after the vulnerability was announced. According to the Drupal security team, where a site was not patched within hours of the announcement, it should be considered compromised and taken offline by being replaced with a static HTML page while the administrator of its server must be told that other sites on the same server may also have been compromised.,
,To solve the problem, the site must be restored using backups from before October 15, be patched and manually updated, and anything merged from the site must be audited.,[100],

,In an article,[101], about the adoption of Drupal by the Whitehouse.gov site, ,Slate, associate editor Chris Wilson,[102], lists some common criticisms of Drupal. Other criticisms have included:,
,
,Usability:, Aspects of the Drupal 6 administration interface were confusing and intimidating to some, particularly for new administrators.,[103],[104],[105], According to Dries Buytaert, Drupal 7 addressed 90% of the problems identified by usability tests conducted at the Universities of Minnesota and Baltimore.,[106],[107], To achieve this, ,Acquia, (the company founded by the project lead of Drupal) hired ,user experience, designer Mark Boulton to work with the Drupal community to design an improved user interface for Drupal's administration interface.,[108], The majority of his team's design work has been implemented by the community in Drupal 7. The 2011 usability test results from the University of Minnesota Office of Information Technology show that all of the major usability problems identified in Drupal 6 are either vastly improved or non-existent in Drupal 7. However, some new usability problems were identified.,[109],[110], Since the release of Drupal 7 there are now various distributions and applications to enhance the Back-end Usability of Drupal such as Drupal Gardens,,[111], Open Enterprise,[112], and Mitkom Builder.,[113],
,Learning curve:, Some users describe Drupal as being difficult to master.,[114],[115], Drupal's many contributed modules can have overlapping functionality and have been reported as overwhelming to new users.,[116],
,Backward compatibility (for software development):, Prior to 7, Drupal did not commit to backward compatibility across major revisions.,[117], This means that module and theme developers may have to rework their code to make it compatible. However, Drupal's policy is to not change how it uses data. This means that data from previous versions is still usable without alteration in the new release.,[118],[119], Drupal documents any incompatibilities, allowing the user to make informed decisions about when and whether to upgrade. Upgrades from 8 to 9 and beyond will require substantially less effort."" ,[120],
,Performance/scalability:, In 2008, ,performance, tests between Drupal 6.1 and ,Joomla, 1.5 demonstrated that Drupal's pages were delivered ""significantly faster"" than those of Joomla.,[121], Despite this, arguments over speed persist.,[122], Drupal is likely to be slower than a special-purpose application for a given task. For example, ,WordPress, typically outperforms Drupal as a single-user blogging tool. Drupal positions itself for broader applications requirements that are outside the scope of more narrowly focused applications.,[123], Drupal offers ,caching, to store various page elements, the use of which resulted in a 508% improvement in one benchmark.,[124], When using Drupal's default Page Cache mechanism, the cached pages are delivered only to anonymous users, so contributed modules must be installed to allow caching content for logged in users.,[125],[126], Like performance, ,scalability, (the ability to add servers to handle growing numbers of visitors with consistent response) can become a concern on large, interactive sites. ,MySQL,'s query caching can help reduce the load on the database server caused by Drupal's high ,query rate,.,[127],[128], Drupal caches database schema ,metadata, as well as elements such as blocks, forms and menus.,[129], Drupal 7 increases performance in database queries and reduces PHP code usage.,[130],
,Integrability with hosting structures:, Because of Drupal's demanding query requirements, Drupal-based websites can quickly become very taxing to hosts whose databases reside on a machine separate from their ,HTTP server,. While the issue can normally be addressed by implementing aggressive ,caching, as described above, such methods may be unimplementable in cases where the host does not offer access to ,PHP accelerators, like ,XCache, or ,APC,. Drupal has plugins that facilitate similar caching without requiring special PHP extensions.,[131],[132],
,The Drupal core search is ineffective at searching content:,[,citation needed,], There are contributed modules that will greatly improve the search functionality on a Drupal website, but they are not easily accessible due to a high learning curve and the difficulty users have in general of finding the right module.,[,citation needed,], One of the faceted search options is ,Apache Solr, Search Integration module, however, the module requires a dedicated server or ,virtual private server, (VPS) to operate because Solr must run on a ,servlet, container, e.g. ,Tomcat,, ,Jetty, or ,Resin,. These requirements make it harder for a Drupal website to have a functional search feature. In response some companies have created Apache Solr ,SaaS, products.,
,Many published, yet incomplete or outdated modules,[133], While Drupal's site boasts over 30,000 downloadable modules, searching the Drupal module directory finds many that are incomplete abandoned projects and do not work at all, only work for an outdated version due to lack of backward compatibility, or are unusable due to serious bugs. This is due to the open source nature of Drupal, and the fact that anyone is free to start a module and publish it on drupal.org. Modules with an active maintenance team are often highly polished, secure, and nearly bug free. Recent changes to the drupal.org website now let users search for modules, themes, and distributions, while filtering results by stability. ,[134],
,
,
,Difficult to unit test:,[135], Drupal 7 doesn't follow MVC framework and stores all of its configurations in database and as a result, unit testing the code without touching the database becomes extremely difficult. As a result, developers have resorted to using integration testing frameworks such as Red Test or behavior-driven development framework such as Behat and Codeception. Drupal 8 has taken a great stride in making it easier for developers to write unit-testable code.,

,You should proceed under the assumption that every Drupal 7 website was compromised unless updated or patched before Oct 15th, 11pm UTC, that is 7 hours after the announcement.,
,Simply updating to Drupal 7.32 will not remove backdoors,....updating to version 7.32 or applying the patch fixes the vulnerability but does not fix an already compromised website. If you find that your site is already patched but you didn’t do it, that can be a symptom that the site was compromised - some attacks have applied the patch as a way to guarantee they are the only attacker in control of the site.,

,Unix, (,/,ˈ,j,uː,n,ɪ,k,s,/,; trademarked as ,UNIX,) is a family of ,multitasking,, ,multiuser, computer ,operating systems, that derive from the original ,AT&T, Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the ,Bell Labs, research center by ,Ken Thompson,, ,Dennis Ritchie,, and others.,[3],
,Initially intended for use inside the ,Bell System,, AT&T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors like the ,University of California, Berkeley, (,BSD,), ,Microsoft, (,Xenix,), ,IBM, (,AIX,), and ,Sun Microsystems, (,Solaris,). In the early 1990s, AT&T sold its rights in Unix to ,Novell,, which then sold its Unix business to the ,Santa Cruz Operation, (SCO) in 1995.,[4], The UNIX trademark passed to ,The Open Group,, a neutral industry consortium, which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the ,Single UNIX Specification, (SUS). As of 2014, the Unix version with the largest installed base is ,Apple,'s ,macOS,.,[5],
,From the perspective of a power user or programmer, Unix systems are characterized by a ,modular design, that is sometimes called the "",Unix philosophy,""—that is to say, the operating system provides a set of simple tools that each perform a limited, well-defined function,,[6], with a unified ,filesystem, as the main means of communication,[3], and a ,shell, scripting and command language to combine the tools to perform complex workflows. Additionally, Unix also distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first ,portable, operating system: almost the entire operating system is written in the ,C programming language, that allowed Unix to reach numerous platforms.,[7],
,Over the years, many ,Unix-like, operating systems have been developed, but ,Linux, is the most popular. In fact, Linux has displaced ,SUS,-certified Unix on many server platforms since its inception in the early 1990s. The world's most-used mobile operating system, ,Android,, is based on Linux.,

,Overview,[,edit,],
,
,
,
,
,Version 7 Unix,, the ,Research Unix, ancestor of all modern Unix systems,
,
,
,Unix was originally meant to be a convenient platform for programmers developing software to be run on it and on other systems, rather than for non-programmers.,[8],[9], The system grew larger as the operating system started spreading in academic circles, as users added their own tools to the system and shared them with colleagues.,[10],
,Unix was designed to be ,portable,, ,multi-tasking, and ,multi-user, in a ,time-sharing, configuration. Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of ,plain text, for storing data; a hierarchical ,file system,; treating devices and certain types of ,inter-process communication, (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of ,software tools,, small programs that can be strung together through a ,command-line interpreter, using ,pipes,, as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality. These concepts are collectively known as the "",Unix philosophy,"". ,Brian Kernighan, and ,Rob Pike, summarize this in ,The Unix Programming Environment, as ""the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves"".,[11],
,By the early 1980s, users began seeing Unix as a potential universal operating system, suitable for computers of all sizes.,[12],[13], The Unix environment and the ,client–server, program model were essential elements in the development of the ,Internet, and the reshaping of computing as centered in ,networks, rather than in individual computers.,
,Both Unix and the ,C programming language, were developed by AT&T and distributed to government and academic institutions, which led to both being ported to a wider variety of machine families than any other operating system.,
,Under Unix, the operating system consists of many utilities along with the master control program, the ,kernel,. The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the ,file system, and other common ""low-level"" tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously. To mediate such access, the kernel has special rights, reflected in the division between ,user space and kernel space,.,
,The ,microkernel, concept was introduced in an effort to reverse the trend towards larger kernels and return to a system in which most tasks were completed by smaller utilities. In an era when a standard computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a ,data terminal, for ,input and output, (I/O), the Unix file model worked quite well, as I/O was generally linear. However, modern systems include networking and other new devices. As graphical user interfaces developed, the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a ,mouse,. In the 1980s, ,non-blocking I/O, and the set of ,inter-process communication, mechanisms were augmented with ,Unix domain sockets,, ,shared memory,, ,message queues,, and ,semaphores,. In microkernel implementations, functions such as network protocols could be moved out of the kernel, while conventional (,monolithic,) Unix implementations have network protocol stacks as part of the kernel.,

,
,
,The pre-history of Unix dates back to the mid-1960s when the ,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,, ,Bell Labs,, and ,General Electric, were developing an innovative ,time-sharing, operating system called ,Multics, for the ,GE-645, mainframe.,[14], Multics introduced ,many innovations,, but had many problems. Frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not by the aims, Bell Labs slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics, ,Ken Thompson,, ,Dennis Ritchie,, ,M. D. McIlroy,, and ,J. F. Ossanna,,,[15], decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale.,
,The new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name. At this stage, the new operating system was a singletasking operating system, not a multitasking one such as Multics.,[15], The name ,Unics, (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, pronounced as "",eunuchs,""), a ,pun, on ,Multics, (Multiplexed Information and Computer Services), was initially suggested for the project in 1970. ,Brian Kernighan, claims the coining for himself, and adds that ""no one can remember"" who came up with the final spelling Unix.,[16], Dennis Ritchie,,[15], Doug McIlroy,,[1], and ,Peter G. Neumann,[17], also credit Kernighan.,
,In 1972, Unix was rewritten in the ,C programming language,.,[18], The migration from assembly to the ,higher-level language, C resulted in much more ,portable, software, requiring only a relatively small amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other ,computing platforms,.,[19], Bell Labs produced several versions of Unix that are collectively referred to as "",Research Unix,"". In 1975, the first source license for UNIX was sold to ,Donald B. Gillies, at the ,University of Illinois, Department of Computer Science.,[20], UIUC graduate student ,Greg Chesson, (who had worked on the UNIX kernel at Bell Labs) was instrumental in negotiating the terms of the license.,[21],
,During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (,BSD, and ,System V,) by commercial startups, including ,Sequent,, ,HP-UX,, ,Solaris,, ,AIX,, and ,Xenix,. In the late 1980s, AT&T ,Unix System Laboratories, and ,Sun Microsystems, developed System V Release 4 (,SVR4,), which was subsequently adopted by many commercial Unix vendors.,
,In the 1990s, Unix-like systems grew in popularity as ,Linux, and BSD distributions were developed through collaboration by a worldwide network of programmers. In 2000, Apple released ,Darwin,, also a Unix-like system, which became the core of the Mac OS X operating system, later renamed ,macOS,.,[22],
,Unix operating systems are widely used in modern ,servers,, ,workstations,, and ,mobile devices,.,[23],

,In the late 1980s, an open operating system standardization effort now known as ,POSIX, provided a common baseline for all operating systems; ,IEEE, based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s, a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the ,Common Open Software Environment, (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the ,Single UNIX Specification, (SUS) administered by ,The Open Group,. Starting in 1998, the Open Group and IEEE started the ,Austin Group,, to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which, by 2008, had become the Open Group Base Specification.,
,In 1999, in an effort towards compatibility, several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's ,Executable and Linkable Format, (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.,
,The ,Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems, and has mainly been used in Linux.,

,The Unix system is composed of several components that were originally packaged together. By including the development environment, libraries, documents and the portable, modifiable source code for all of these components, in addition to the ,kernel, of an operating system, Unix was a self-contained software system. This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence.,[,according to whom?,],
,The inclusion of these components did not make the system large –  the original V7 UNIX distribution, consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10 MB and arrived on a single nine-track ,magnetic tape,. The printed documentation, typeset from the online sources, was contained in two volumes.,
,The names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system. Nonetheless, the V7 implementation is considered by many,[,who?,], to have the canonical early structure:,
,
,Kernel, –  source code in /usr/sys, composed of several sub-components:
,
,conf, –  configuration and machine-dependent parts, including boot code,
,dev, –  device drivers for control of hardware (and some pseudo-hardware),
,sys, –  operating system ""kernel"", handling memory management, process scheduling, system calls, etc.,
,h, –  header files, defining key structures within the system and important system-specific invariables,
,
,
,Development environment, –  early versions of Unix contained a development environment sufficient to recreate the entire system from source code:
,
,cc, –  ,C language, compiler (first appeared in V3 Unix),
,as, –  machine-language assembler for the machine,
,ld, –  linker, for combining object files,
,lib, –  object-code libraries (installed in /lib or /usr/lib). ,libc,, the system library with C run-time support, was the primary library, but there have always been additional libraries for such things as mathematical functions (,libm,) or database access. V7 Unix introduced the first version of the modern ""Standard I/O"" library ,stdio, as part of the system library. Later implementations increased the number of libraries significantly.,
,make, –  build manager (introduced in ,PWB/UNIX,), for effectively automating the build process,
,include, –  header files for software development, defining standard interfaces and system invariants,
,Other languages, –  V7 Unix contained a Fortran-77 compiler, a programmable arbitrary-precision calculator (,bc,, ,dc,), and the ,awk, scripting language; later versions and implementations contain many other language compilers and toolsets. Early BSD releases included ,Pascal, tools, and many modern Unix systems also include the ,GNU Compiler Collection, as well as or instead of a proprietary compiler system.,
,Other tools, –  including an object-code archive manager (,ar,), symbol-table lister (,nm,), compiler-development tools (e.g. ,lex, & ,yacc,), and debugging tools.,
,
,
,Commands, –  Unix makes little distinction between commands (user-level programs) for system operation and maintenance (e.g. ,cron,), commands of general utility (e.g. ,grep,), and more general-purpose applications such as the text formatting and typesetting package. Nonetheless, some major categories are:
,
,sh, –  the ""shell"" programmable ,command-line interpreter,, the primary user interface on Unix before window systems appeared, and even afterward (within a ""command window"").,
,Utilities, –  the core toolkit of the Unix command set, including ,cp,, ,ls,, ,grep,, ,find, and many others. Subcategories include:
,
,System utilities, –  administrative tools such as ,mkfs,, ,fsck,, and many others.,
,User utilities, –  environment management tools such as ,passwd,, ,kill,, and others.,
,
,
,Document formatting, –  Unix systems were used from the outset for document preparation and typesetting systems, and included many related programs such as ,nroff,, ,troff,, ,tbl,, ,eqn,, ,refer,, and ,pic,. Some modern Unix systems also include packages such as ,TeX, and ,Ghostscript,.,
,Graphics, –  the ,plot, subsystem provided facilities for producing simple vector plots in a device-independent format, with device-specific interpreters to display such files. Modern Unix systems also generally include ,X11, as a standard windowing system and ,GUI,, and many support ,OpenGL,.,
,Communications, –  early Unix systems contained no inter-system communication, but did include the inter-user communication programs ,mail, and ,write,. V7 introduced the early inter-system communication system ,UUCP,, and systems beginning with BSD release 4.1c included ,TCP/IP, utilities.,
,
,
,Documentation, –  Unix was the first,[,citation needed,], operating system to include all of its documentation online in machine-readable form. The documentation included:
,
,man, –  manual pages for each command, library component, ,system call,, header file, etc.,
,doc, –  longer documents detailing major subsystems, such as the C language and troff,

,Plan 9 from Bell Labs, extends Unix design principles, and was developed as a successor to Unix,
,
,
,The Unix system had significant impact on other operating systems. It achieved its reputation by its interactivity, by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use, by running on inexpensive hardware, and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines. Unix was originally written in ,assembly language, (which had been thought necessary for system implementations on early computers), but was soon rewritten in ,C,, a ,high-level programming language,.,[24], Although this followed the lead of ,Multics, and ,Burroughs,, it was Unix that popularized the idea.,
,Unix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as ,printers,, ,terminals,, or ,disk drives,), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ,ioctl, and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple ""stream of bytes"" model. The ,Plan 9, operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.,
,Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's ,RSX-11,M's ""group, user"" hierarchy evolved into ,VMS, directories, ,CP/M,'s volumes evolved into ,MS-DOS, 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's ,MPE, group.account hierarchy and IBM's ,SSP, and ,OS/400, library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.,
,Making the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The ,Unix shell, used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting (,shell scripts, – there was no separate job control language like IBM's ,JCL,). Since the shell and OS commands were ""just another program"", the user could choose (or even write) his own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains of producer-consumer processes (,pipelines,) made a powerful programming paradigm (,coroutines,) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell.,
,A fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on ,newline,-,delimited, text for nearly all file formats. There were no ""binary"" editors in the original version of Unix – the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts. The common denominator in the I/O system was the byte – unlike ,""record-based"" file systems,. The focus on text for representing nearly everything made Unix pipes especially useful, and encouraged the development of simple, general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated ,ad hoc, tasks. The focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems. Over time, text-based applications have also proven popular in application areas, such as printing languages (,PostScript,, ,ODF,), and at the application layer of the ,Internet protocols,, e.g., ,FTP,, ,SMTP,, ,HTTP,, ,SOAP,, and ,SIP,.,
,Unix popularized a syntax for ,regular expressions, that found widespread use. The Unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard (POSIX, see above). The ,C programming language, soon spread beyond Unix, and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming.,
,Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of ,modularity, and ,reusability, into ,software engineering, practice, spawning a ""software tools"" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the ,Unix philosophy,.,
,The ,TCP/IP networking protocols, were quickly implemented on the Unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers, which contributed to the ,Internet, explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity, and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms.,
,The Unix policy of extensive on-line documentation and (for many years) ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations, and contributed to the 1983 launch of the ,free software movement,.,

,In 1983, ,Richard Stallman, announced the ,GNU, (short for ""GNU's Not Unix"") project, an ambitious effort to create a ,free software, ,Unix-like, system; ""free"" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, ,GNU Hurd,, had not produced a working kernel, but in 1991 ,Linus Torvalds, released the ,Linux kernel, as free software under the ,GNU General Public License,. In addition to their use in the ,Linux, operating system, many GNU packages – such as the ,GNU Compiler Collection, (and the rest of the ,GNU toolchain,), the ,GNU C library, and the ,GNU core utilities, – have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.,
,Linux distributions,, consisting of the Linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business. Popular distributions include ,Red Hat Enterprise Linux,, ,Fedora,, ,SUSE Linux Enterprise,, ,openSUSE,, ,Debian GNU/Linux,, ,Ubuntu,, ,Linux Mint,, ,Mandriva Linux,, ,Slackware Linux,, and ,Gentoo,.,
,A free derivative of ,BSD, Unix, ,386BSD,, was released in 1992 and led to the ,NetBSD, and ,FreeBSD, projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (,USL v. BSDi,) by ,UNIX Systems Laboratories,, it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix for free, if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different product branches, including ,OpenBSD, and ,DragonFly BSD,.,
,Linux and BSD are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary Unix operating systems, as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices. Because of the modular design of the Unix model, sharing components is relatively common; consequently, most or all Unix and Unix-like systems include at least some BSD code, and some systems also include GNU utilities in their distributions.,
,In a 1999 interview, Dennis Ritchie voiced his opinion that Linux and BSD operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the Unix design, and are derivatives of Unix:,[25],
,
,""I think the Linux phenomenon is quite delightful, because it draws so strongly on the basis that Unix provided. Linux seems to be the among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers."",
,
,In the same interview, he states that he views both Unix and Linux as ""the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago."",[25],
,OpenSolaris, was the open-source counterpart to ,Solaris, developed by ,Sun Microsystems,, which included a ,CDDL,-licensed kernel and a primarily ,GNU, userland. However, ,Oracle, discontinued the project upon their acquisition of Sun, which prompted a group of former Sun employees and members of the OpenSolaris community to fork OpenSolaris into the ,illumos, kernel. As of 2014, illumos remains the only active open-source System V derivative.,
,ARPANET,[,edit,],
,In May 1975, ,RFC 681, described the development of ,Network Unix, by the Center for Advanced Computation at the ,University of Illinois,. The system was said to ""present several interesting capabilities as an ,ARPANET, mini-host"". At the time Unix required a license from ,Bell Laboratories, that at $20,000(US) was very expensive for non-,university, users, while an educational license cost just $150. It was noted that Bell was ""open to suggestions"" for an ARPANET-wide license.,
,Specific features found beneficial were the local processing facilities, ,compilers,, ,editors,, a ,document preparation system,, efficient file system and access control, ,mountable, and unmountable volumes, unified treatment of peripherals as ,special files,, integration of the ,network control program, (NCP) within the Unix file system, treatment of ,network connections, as special files that can be accessed through standard Unix ,I/O calls,, closing of all files on program exit, and the decision to be ""desirable to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel"".,

,In October 1993, ,Novell,, the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time, transferred the ,trademarks, of Unix to the X/Open Company (now ,The Open Group,),,[26], and in 1995 sold the related business operations to ,Santa Cruz Operation, (SCO).,[27], Whether Novell also sold the ,copyrights, to the actual software was the subject of a 2006 federal lawsuit, ,SCO v. Novell,, which Novell won. The case was appealed, but on August 30, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the trial decisions, closing the case.,[28], Unix vendor ,SCO Group Inc., accused Novell of ,slander of title,.,
,The present owner of the trademark ,UNIX, is The Open Group, an industry standards consortium. Only systems fully compliant with and certified to the ,Single UNIX Specification, qualify as ""UNIX"" (others are called "",Unix-like,"").,
,By decree of The Open Group, the term ""UNIX"" refers more to a class of operating systems than to a specific implementation of an operating system; those operating systems which meet The Open Group's Single UNIX Specification should be able to bear the ,UNIX 98, or ,UNIX 03, trademarks today, after the operating system's vendor pays a substantial certification fee and annual trademark royalties to The Open Group.,[29], Systems licensed to use the UNIX trademark include ,AIX,,,[30], ,HP-UX,,,[31], ,Inspur K-UX,,,[32], ,IRIX,,,[33], ,Solaris,,,[34], ,Tru64 UNIX, (formerly ""Digital UNIX"", or ,OSF/1,),,[35], ,macOS,,,[36], and a part of ,z/OS,.,[37], Notably, Inspur K-UX is a Linux distribution certified as UNIX 03 compliant.,[38],[39],
,Sometimes a representation like ,Un*x,, ,*NIX,, or ,*N?X, is used to indicate all operating systems similar to Unix. This comes from the use of the asterisk (,*,) and the question mark characters as wildcard indicators in many utilities. This notation is also used to describe other Unix-like systems that have not met the requirements for UNIX branding from the Open Group.,
,The Open Group requests that ,UNIX, is always used as an adjective followed by a generic term such as ,system, to help avoid the creation of a ,genericized trademark,.,
,Unix, was the original formatting, but the usage of ,UNIX, remains widespread because it was once typeset in ,small caps, (,Unix,). According to ,Dennis Ritchie,, when presenting the original Unix paper to the third Operating Systems Symposium of the American ,Association for Computing Machinery, (ACM), ""we had a new typesetter and ,troff, had just been invented and we were intoxicated by being able to produce small caps."",[40], Many of the operating system's predecessors and contemporaries used all-uppercase lettering, so many people wrote the name in upper case due to force of habit. It is not an acronym.,[41],
,Trademark names can be registered by different entities in different countries and trademark laws in some countries allow the same trademark name to be controlled by two different entities if each entity uses the trademark in easily distinguishable categories. The result is that Unix has been used as a brand name for various products including book shelves, ink pens, bottled glue, diapers, hair driers and food containers.,[42],
,Several plural forms of Unix are used casually to refer to multiple brands of Unix and Unix-like systems. Most common is the conventional ,Unixes,, but ,Unices,, treating Unix as a ,Latin, noun of the ,third declension,, is also popular. The pseudo-,Anglo-Saxon, plural form ,Unixen, is not common, although occasionally seen. ,Sun Microsystems,, developer of the Solaris variant, has asserted that the term ,Unix, is itself plural, referencing its many implementations.,[43],

,Career,[,edit,],
,Buytaert defended his PhD dissertation in ,Computer Science, on 27 January 2008,[5], at ,Ghent University, in Belgium.,[6],
,From 1999-2000 he was the maintainer of the ,Linux,-,WLAN, FAQ,.,[7],
,It was during this time that he founded the concept of Drupal. At first, Dries maintained a small news site and a web board, but it developed to attract more audience.,[8],
,On 1 December 2007, Dries,[9], announced, together with co-founder ,Jay Batson, the launch of a start-up called ,Acquia,.,[10], Acquia is a commercial open-source software company providing products, services, and technical support for ,Drupal,. Acquia wants to be to Drupal what ,Red Hat, has been to ,Linux,.,[11], In 2009, Acquia helped re-launch Whitehouse.gov on Drupal.,[12],
,On 31 March 2008, Dries launched ,Mollom,, a service dedicated to stopping website spam: ""Mollom's purpose is to dramatically reduce the effort of keeping your site clean and the quality of your content high. Currently, Mollom is a spam-killing one-two punch combination of a state-of-the-art spam filter and CAPTCHA server."" Over 59,000 websites are protected by the Mollom service,,[13], including all of ,Netlog,'s messages.,[14],
,In 2008, Buytaert was elected ""Young Entrepreneurs of Tech"" by ,BusinessWeek,.,[15], He was also named to the ,MIT, ,Technology Review, ,TR35, as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.,[16],[17],

,Childhood,[,edit,],
,Theo de Raadt is the eldest of four children to a ,Dutch, father and a ,South African, mother, with two sisters and a brother. Concern over the mandatory two-year armed forces ,conscription, in South Africa led the family to emigrate to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in November 1977. In 1983, the ,largest recession in Canada, since the ,Great Depression, sent the family to the ,Yukon,. Prior to the move, De Raadt got his first computer, a ,Commodore VIC-20,, which was soon followed by an ,Amiga,. It is with these computers that he first began to develop software.,[1],
,In 1992, he obtained a ,BSc, in ,Computer Science, from the ,University of Calgary,.,
,NetBSD,[,edit,],
,The ,NetBSD, project was founded in 1993 by Chris Demetriou, Adam Glass, Charles Hannum, and De Raadt, who collectively felt frustration at the speed and quality of ,Jolix,, the standard Berkeley software distribution then, and believed that a more open development model would be of greater benefit to development of an operating system. Jolix, also known as ,386BSD,, was derived from the original University of California Berkeley's 4.3BSD release, while the new NetBSD project would merge relevant code from the Networking/2 and 386BSD releases. The new project would centre its focus on clean, portable, correct code with the goal being to produce a unified, multi-platform, production-quality, BSD-based operating system.,
,Because of the importance of networks such as the Internet in the distributed, collaborative nature of its development, De Raadt suggested the name ""NetBSD"", which the three other founders agreed upon.,[,citation needed,],
,The first NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the initial release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April 1993. This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements. In August 1993, NetBSD 0.9 was released, which contained many enhancements and bug fixes. This was still a ,PC,-platform-only release, although by this time work was underway to add support for other architectures.,
,NetBSD 1.0 was released in October, 1994. This was the first multi-platform release, supporting the ,IBM PC compatible,, ,HP 9000, Series 300, ,Amiga,, ,68k, ,Macintosh,, ,Sun-4c, series and ,PC532,. Also in this release, the legally encumbered Net/2-derived source code was replaced with equivalent code from 4.4BSD-lite, in accordance with the ,USL v BSDi, lawsuit settlement. De Raadt played a vital role in the creation of the ,SPARC, port, as together with Chuck Cranor,,[2], he implemented much of the initial code.,
,OpenBSD,[,edit,],
,In December 1994, De Raadt was asked to resign his position as a senior developer and member of the NetBSD core team, and his access to the source code repository was revoked. The reason for this is not wholly clear, although there are claims that it was due to personality clashes within the NetBSD project and on its ,mailing lists,.,[3], De Raadt has been criticized for having a somewhat abrasive personality: in his book, ,Free for All,, Peter Wayner claims that De Raadt ""began to rub some people the wrong way"" before the split from NetBSD;,[4], while ,Linus Torvalds, has described him as ""difficult"".,[5], Many have different feelings: the same interviewer describes De Raadt's ""transformation"" on founding OpenBSD and his ""desire to take care of his team,"" some find his straightforwardness refreshing, and few deny he is a talented ,hacker,[6], and security ""guru"".,[7],
,In October 1995, De Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project ,forked, from NetBSD 1.0. The initial ,release,, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed in October of the same year by OpenBSD 2.0.,[8], Since then, the project has followed a schedule of a release every six months, each of which is maintained and supported for one year.,
,Outspokenness,[,edit,],
,
,
,
,
,Jon ""maddog"" Hall, presents De Raadt with ,daemon, horns at ,FISL8,
,
,
,De Raadt has been a vocal advocate of free software since the inception of OpenBSD, but he is also a strong proponent of free speech, having on occasion had rather public disputes with various groups, from Linux advocates to governments. This outspoken attitude, while sometimes the cause of conflict, has also led him to acclaim; De Raadt has given presentations at open source, free software and security conferences around the world—including ,FOSDEM, in ,Brussels,, ,Belgium,, ,Usenix, in ,San Antonio, Texas,, ,U.S.,, ,AUUG, Conference in ,Melbourne,, ,Australia, and ,FISL, in ,Porto Alegre,, RS, ,Brazil,.,
,DARPA funding cancellation,[,edit,],
,After De Raadt stated his disapproval of the U.S.-led ,occupation of Iraq, in an April, 2003 ,interview,[9], with ,Toronto,'s ,Globe and Mail,, a multi-million-dollar ,US Department of Defense, grant to the ,University of Pennsylvania,'s ,POSSE project, was cancelled, effectively ending the project. Funding from the grant had been used in the development of OpenSSH and OpenBSD, as well as many other projects and was to be used to pay for the ,hackathon, planned for May 8, 2003. Despite money from the grant already having been used to secure accommodations for sixty developers for a week, the money was reclaimed by the government at a loss and the hotel was told not to allow the developers to pay the reclaimed money to resecure the rooms.,[10], This resulted in criticism among some that the US military held an anti-,free speech, attitude. The grant termination was, however, not as bad a blow as some portrayed it. The project's supporters rallied to help and the hackathon went on almost as planned. The funding was cut mere months before the end of the grant, further fueling the speculations regarding the situation surrounding the grant's termination.,
,Free driver advocacy,[,edit,],
,De Raadt is also well known for his advocacy of ,free software, ,drivers,. He has long been critical of developers of ,Linux, and other free platforms for their tolerance of non-free drivers and acceptance of ,non-disclosure agreements,.,
,In particular, De Raadt has worked to convince ,wireless, hardware vendors to allow the ,firmware, images of their products to be freely redistributed. These efforts have been largely successful, particularly in negotiations with ,Taiwanese, companies, leading to many new wireless drivers. De Raadt has commented that ""most Taiwanese vendors give us documentation almost immediately"", allowing open source drivers to reliably support devices, as opposed to the lack of willingness from US companies like ,Intel, and ,Broadcom, to release firmware images free from ,licensing, restrictions.,[11],
,For this De Raadt was awarded the ,Free Software Foundation,'s 2004 ,Award for the Advancement of Free Software,.,[12],
,Clash with Linux developers,[,edit,],
,In April 2007, De Raadt was involved in a controversy involving the use of ,GPL, code from the Linux ,bcm43xx, driver in the BSD ,bcw, driver.,[13],[14], Linux developers accused the BSD community of infringing GPL code, but De Raadt denied infringement, arguing that the BSD driver was not ""released"". He also maintained that the conflict was not about GPL, but the way Linux developer ,Michael Buesch, handled the situation. To Buesch's email, he responded:,[15],
,
,It will be resolved in our tree, but it is up to him which way he does it. But when you approach issues like this with comments like ""We'd like you to start contacting us to resolve the issue now"" and your first mail is cc'd to a couple hundred people.... in the future, please think more carefully, ok?,
,Because right now, in that mail, you've pretty much done Broadcom's job for them. You've told the entire BSD community who may want to use a driver for this chip later, that because of a few GPL issues you are willing to use very strong words—published very widely—to disrupt the efforts of one guy who is trying to do things for them. And, you are going to do this using the GPL, even. You did not privately mail that developer. No, you basically went public with it.,
,That is how about half the user and developer community will see it. They will see your widely posted mail as an overly strong position.,
,
,Another clash occurred in August 2007, when a group of Linux developers attempted to modify the license of dual-licensed ath5k driver. De Raadt summarized the issue as follows:,[16],
,
,GPL fans said the great problem we would face is that companies would take our BSD code, modify it, and not give back. Nope—the great problem we face is that people would wrap the GPL around our code, and lock us out in the same way that these supposed companies would lock us out. Just like the Linux community, we have many companies giving us code back, all the time. But once the code is GPL'd, we cannot get it back.,

,Ethereum, is an ,open-source,, public, ,blockchain,-based ,distributed computing, platform featuring ,smart contract, (scripting) functionality.,[1], More specifically, it is a distributed ledger for state transitions. It is the bockchain network for ,Ether,, a ,cryptocurrency,. Ether can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed.,[2], Etherium provides a decentralized ,Turing-complete, ,virtual machine,, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. ""Gas"", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate ,spam, and allocate resources on the network.,[1],[3],
,Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by ,Vitalik Buterin,, a ,cryptocurrency, researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online ,crowdsale, that took place between July and August 2014. ,[4], The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 11.9 million coins ""premined"" for the crowdsale.,[5], This accounts for approximately 13 percent of the total circulating supply.,
,In 2016, as a result of the collapse of ,The DAO, project, Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains – the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH), and the original continued as ,Ethereum Classic, (ETC).,[6],[7],[8], The value of the Ethereum currency grew over 13,000 percent in 2017.,[9],

,Etymology,[,edit,],
,Vitalik Buterin picked the name Ethereum after browsing Wikipedia articles about elements and science fiction, when he found the name, noting, ""I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was the fact that sounded nice and it had the word ""ether"", referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel."",[10],
,History,[,edit,],
,Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by ,Vitalik Buterin,,,[11], a programmer involved with ,Bitcoin Magazine,, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications.,[12],[13], Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a ,scripting language, for application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[14],:,88,
,At the time of public announcement in January 2014, the core Ethereum team was Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson.,[15], Formal development of the Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a ,Swiss, company, ,Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, (,EthSuisse,).,[16],[17], Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (,Stiftung Ethereum,), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public ,crowdsale, during July–August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency, ,bitcoin,.,[4], While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.,[12],
,Milestones,[,edit,],
,Several codenamed prototypes of the Ethereum platform were developed by the Foundation, as part of their Proof-of-Concept series, prior to the official launch of the Frontier network. ""Olympic"" was the last of these prototypes, and public beta pre-release.,[18],[19], The Olympic network provided users with a ,bug bounty, of 25,000 ether for stress testing the limits of the Ethereum blockchain. ""Frontier"" marked the tentative experimental release of the Ethereum platform in July 2015.,[20],[21],
,""Homestead"" was the first to be considered ,stable,.,[22],[23], It includes improvements to transaction processing, gas pricing, and security.,[24],[22],[25], Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or ,incentive structures, of the platform.,[26],[27],
,There are at least two other protocol upgrades planned in the future: ""Metropolis"" is intended to reduce the complexity of the EVM and provide more flexibility for smart contract developers.,[27], Metropolis also adds supports for zkSnarks (from ,Zcash,); with the first zksnarks transaction occurring on testnet on September 19, 2017.,[28], ""Serenity"" should include a fundamental change to Ethereum's consensus algorithm to enable a basic transition from hardware mining (,proof-of-work,) to virtual mining (,proof-of-stake,).,[27],[29], Improvements to ,scalability,, specifically ,sharding,, are also said to be a key objective on the development roadmap.,[30],[31],

,Public Testnets,[,edit,],
,Ethereum has three active public testnets: Ropsten (Proof of Work secured), Kovan (Parity based Proof of Authority secured), and Rinkeby (Clique Proof of Authority scheme). There is no Proof of Stake secured testnet. Each testnet has its own distinct genesis block, and are fully functional testing grounds for decentralized applications. Testnet Ether is not supposed to have market value.,
,The DAO event,[,edit,],
,In 2016 a ,decentralized autonomous organization, called ,The DAO,, a set of ,smart contracts, developed on the platform, raised a record ,US$150 million, in a ,crowdsale, to fund the project.,[32], The DAO was exploited in June when ,US$50 million, in ether were claimed by an anonymous entity.,[33],[34], The event sparked a debate in the crypto-community about whether Ethereum should perform a contentious ""hard fork"" to reappropriate the affected funds.,[35], As a result of the dispute, the network split in two. Ethereum (the subject of this article) continued on the forked blockchain, while ,Ethereum Classic, continued on the original blockchain.,[36], The hard fork created a rivalry between the two networks.,[37],
,Hard Forks,[,edit,],
,After the hard fork related to The DAO, Ethereum subsequently forked twice in the fourth quarter of 2016 to deal with other attacks.,[38], By the end of November 2016, Ethereum had increased its ,DDoS, protection, de-bloated the blockchain, and thwarted further spam attacks by hackers.,[25],
,Architecture,[,edit,],
,Ether,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Ether (currency),
,The value token of the Ethereum blockchain is called ether. It is listed under the code ETH and traded on ,cryptocurrency, exchanges, and the ,Greek, ,uppercase Xi, character (Ξ) is generally used for its ,currency symbol,. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.,[39],
,Ethereum Virtual Machine,[,edit,],
,The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM),[40],[41], is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper, original version by ,Gavin Wood,.,[42],[,better source needed,],[43], It is sandboxed and also completely isolated from the network, filesystem or other processes of the host computer system. Every Ethereum node in the network runs an EVM implementation and executes the same instructions. Ethereum Virtual Machines have been implemented in ,C++,, ,Go,, ,Haskell,, ,Java,, ,JavaScript,, ,Python,, ,Ruby,, ,Rust,, and ,WebAssembly, (currently under development).,[44],[45],
,Smart contracts,[,edit,],
,Ethereum's ,smart contracts, are based on computer language, which developers use to program their own functionalities.,[46], Smart contracts are ,high-level, programming ,abstractions, that are compiled down to EVM ,bytecode, and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in ,Solidity, (a language library with similarities to ,C, and ,JavaScript,), Serpent (similar to ,Python,), LLL (a ,low-level, ,Lisp,-like language), and Mutan (,Go,-based, but deprecated). There is also a research-oriented language under development called Viper (a ,strongly-typed, ,Python,-derived ,decidable language,).,[47],
,Smart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained ,provably fair, casinos.,[48],
,One issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.,[49], One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.,[33],
,There is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties. A ,Microsoft Research, report noted that writing solid smart contracts can be extremely difficult in practice, using The DAO hack to illustrate this problem. The report discussed tools that Microsoft had developed for verifying contracts, and noted that a large-scale analysis of published contracts is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities. The report also stated that it is possible to verify the equivalence of a Solidity program and the EVM code.,[50],
,Performance,[,edit,],
,In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has trade-offs.,[51], Being a ,blockchain, means it is ,secure by design, and is an example of a distributed computing system with high ,Byzantine fault tolerance,. The downside is that performance issues arise in that every node is calculating all the smart contracts in real time, resulting in lower speeds.,[51], As of January 2016, the Ethereum protocol could process 25 transactions per second.,[51], On 19 December 2016, Ethereum exceeded one million transactions in a single day for the first time.,[52],
,
,Micro Raiden was launched November 2017.,[53],
,Buterin and Joseph Poon (a co-author of ,Bitcoin,'s lightning network whitepaper) announced in 2017 their plan to launch a scaling solution called Plasma which creates ""child"" blockchains to the ""main"" parent blockchain.,[54], The plasma project is not without skeptics, specifically Vlad Zamfir (Ethereum's lead researcher on proof of stake) has publicly questioned the plasma project's viability.,[54],
,Ethereum engineers have been working on ,sharding, the calculations, and the next step (called Ethereum 2) was presented at Devcon 3.,[55],
,
,Ethereum's blockchain uses ,Merkle Patricia trees,, for security reasons, to improve scalability, and to optimize transaction hashing.,[56],
,Proposed uses,[,edit,],
,Many uses have been proposed for Ethereum platform, including ones that are impossible or unfeasible.,[57],[58],[39], Use case proposals have included finance, the ,internet-of-things,, ,farm-to-table, produce, ,electricity sourcing and pricing,, and ,sports betting,.,[39],[59], Ethereum is (as of 2017) the leading ,blockchain, platform for ,initial coin offering, projects, with over 50% market share.,[60],
,Decentralized applications,[,edit,],
,The projects listed in this section are not exhaustive and may be outdated.,
,
,Digital signatures, that ensure authenticity and proof of existence of documents: the ,Luxembourg Stock Exchange, has developed such a system,[61],
,Slock.It, is developing ,smart locks,[62],
,Digital tokens ,pegged, to ,fiat currencies,: Dai, stablecoin pegged to US dollar.,[63], ,Decentralized Capital.,[64], Spanish bank ,Santander, is also involved in such a project,[65],.,
,Digital tokens ,pegged, to ,gold,: ,Digix,[4],[66],
,Improved ,digital rights management, for music: ,Imogen Heap, used the technology,[67],
,Platforms for ,prediction markets,: ,Augur,, Gnosis,[68],[69], Stox,[70],[71],
,Platforms for ,crowdfunding,: ,the DAO,[72],[73],[32],
,Social media platforms with economic incentives: ,Backfeed,,[74], ,Akasha,[75],
,Decentralized marketplaces: ,FreeMyVunk,,[76], ,Etheropt,,[77], ,TransActive Grid,[78],
,Remittance: ,Everex,[79],
,Online ,gambling,: ,Etheroll,[80],
,Electric car charging management: RWE,[81],
,Secure ,identity systems, for the Internet: ,uPort,[82],[83],
,Labour economics,: ,Blocklancer,,,[84], ,Ethlance,[85],
,Video Games,: ,Cryptokitties, popularity in December 2017 caused the Ethereum network to slow down.,[86],
,
,Enterprise software,[,edit,],
,Ethereum-based customized software and networks, independent from the public Ethereum chain, are being tested by ,enterprise software, companies.,[87], Interested parties include ,Microsoft,, ,IBM,, ,JPMorgan Chase,,,[39],[88], ,Deloitte,,,[89], ,R3,,,[90], ,Innovate UK, (cross-border payments prototype).,[91],[92], Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse are experimenting with Ethereum blockchain to automate Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II requirements.,[93],
,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA),[,edit,],
,In March 2017, various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members.,[94], By May, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members—including ,ConsenSys,, ,CME Group,, ,Cornell University's research group,, ,Toyota Research Institute,, ,Samsung SDS,, ,Microsoft,, ,Intel,, ,J.P. Morgan,, ,Cooley LLP,, ,Merck KGaA,, ,DTCC,, ,Deloitte,, ,Accenture,, ,Banco Santander,, ,BNY Mellon,, ,ING,, and ,National Bank of Canada,.,[95],[96],[97],
,The purpose of the EEA is to coordinate the engineering of an open-source reference standard and private ""permissioned"" version of the Ethereum blockchain that can address the common interests of enterprises in banking, management, consulting, automotive, pharmaceutical, health, technology, mobile, entertainment, and other industries, while working with developers from the Ethereum ecosystem. Certain members of the alliance have also indicated a desire to investigate and collaborate on hybrid architectures to potentially anchor private blockchains to the public Ethereum blockchain in the future, although concerns remain over the security, compliance, and regulations involved in bridging such permissioned and ""permissionless"" blockchains.,[94],
,By July 2017, there were over 150 members in the alliance, including recent additions ,MasterCard,, ,Cisco Systems,, and ,Scotiabank,.,[98],
,Permissioned ledgers,[,edit,],
,Ethereum-based ,permissioned blockchain, variants are used and being investigated for various projects.,
,
,J.P. Morgan Chase, is developing a permissioned-variant of Ethereum blockchain dubbed ""Quorum."",[99], It's designed to toe the line between private and public in the realm of shuffling derivatives and payments. The idea is to satisfy regulators who need seamless access to financial goings-on, while protecting the privacy of parties that don't wish to reveal their identities nor the details of their transactions to the general public.,[100],
,Royal Bank of Scotland, has announced that it has built a Clearing and Settlement Mechanism (CSM) based on the Ethereum distributed ledger and smart contract platform.,[101],[102],
,
,Ethereums,[,edit,],
,Ethereums refer to the broad category that consists of all cryptocurrencies which emerged from the original ,Ethereum, blockchain:,
,
,Ethereum Classic,
,Expanse.,[103],
,Ethereum Fog,[104],
,EtherZero,[105],
,Ethereum Vega,[106],
,Etherite,[107],
,Ethereum Dark,[108],
,
,Ethereums can also refer for all ,tokens, developed and run on the Ethereum blockchain,[109],
,Criticisms,[,edit,],
,A finance blogger on ,FT Alphaville, has pointed out that criminals are using Ethereum to run ,Ponzi schemes, and other forms of investment fraud.,[110], The article was based on a paper from the ,University of Cagliari,, which placed the number of Ethereum smart contracts which facilitate Ponzi schemes at nearly 10% of 1384 smart contracts examined. However, it also estimated that only 0.05% of the transactions on the network were related to such contracts.,[111],

,Personal life,[,edit,],
,Buterin was born in ,Kolomna,, ,Moscow Oblast,, ,Russia, to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist, and Natalia Ameline (née Chistyakova).,[,citation needed,], He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents emigrated to ,Canada, in search of better employment opportunities. While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children and started to understand that he was drawn to math, programming, and economics. He also had the ability to add three-digit numbers in his head at twice the speed of his peers.,[4], Buterin attended the ,Abelard School,, a private high school in Toronto, for four years,,[5], which he said, ""proved to be among the most interesting and productive years of my life; the closer connection between students and teachers [&] the level of depth at which the material was taught, made me want to learn, and to focus on learning as my primary goal"".,[5], Buterin has written that although he was ""never particularly inspired by the traditional education system"",,[5], when subjects were presented with ""dedication and focus on intellectual inquiry"", he said he:,
,
,""noticed my attitude and my results almost immediately and drastically change. Education is ultimately much more than simply memorizing individual facts, or even learning individual concepts. [What] matters most: learning how to think, learning how to reason and learning how to learn."",[5],
,
,Buterin learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at age 17.,[4], In 2012, he obtained a Bronze Medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics.,[6], In 2013 he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a white paper proposing Ethereum.,[7], He attended the ,University of Waterloo, but dropped out in 2014, when he received the ,Thiel Fellowship, in the amount of $100,000,,[8], and went to work on Ethereum full-time.,[8],
,On June 25, 2017, Buterin was the subject of a ,death hoax, originating from ,4chan,.,[9],

,Beginnings at ,Bitcoin Magazine,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Bitcoin Magazine,
,Buterin met a person on a bitcoin chat forum trying to start a bitcoin blog. The owner offered five bitcoin (about $3.50) to anyone who would write an article for him. Buterin wrote for the site until its website shut down soon thereafter due to Bitcoin's lack of mainstream attention.,[10],
,In September 2011, another person reached out to Buterin about a new publication called ,Bitcoin Magazine,, a position which Buterin would accept as the first co-founder, and contribute as a leading writer.,
,In addition Buterin wrote about bitcoin-related topics for other publications, including ,Bitcoin Weekly,.,[1],[11], ,Bitcoin Magazine, in 2012 later began publishing a print edition and has been referred to as the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies.,[12], ,Bitcoin Magazine, was then purchased by ,BTC Media,, where Buterin continued to write until mid-2014.,
,In addition, he held a position on the editorial board of ,Ledger,, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes full-length original research articles on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.,[13],
,Ethereum,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Ethereum,
,He is a co-creator and inventor of Ethereum, described as a “decentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one” that facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and programs that share a single ,blockchain, (a cryptographic transaction ledger).,[14],[15],[16],
,Ethereum was first described in Buterin's white paper, in late 2013. Buterin argued that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But when he failed to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[17], About the Ethereum Project, Buterin has said: ""I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week."",[5],
,Open source software,[,edit,],
,Vitalik has contributed as a developer to other open source software projects.,[1], Some early examples are: Kryptokit, pybitcointools, multisig.info, and btckeysplit.,[18], He also contributed to DarkWallet,[19], by ,Cody Wilson,, ,Bitcoin, ,Python, libraries,,[20], and the ,cryptocurrency, marketplace site Egora.,[2],

A timeline chart of how ,Linux distributions, forked.,
,
,
,In ,software engineering,, a ,project fork, happens when developers take a copy of ,source code, from one ,software package, and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a ,development branch,, but also a split in the developer community, a form of ,schism,.,[1],
,Free and open-source software, is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating ,copyright, law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (,e.g., ,Unix,) also happen.,

,
,Etymology,[,edit,],
,The word fork stems from the Latin word furca, meaning a ""fork or similarly shaped instrument."",[2], ""Fork"" in the meaning of ""to divide in branches, go separate ways"" has been used as early as the 14th century.,[3], In the software environment, the word evokes the ,fork, system call, which causes a running process to split itself into two (almost) identical copies that (typically) diverge to perform different tasks.,[4],
,In the context of software development, ""fork"" was used in the sense of creating a revision control "",branch,"" by ,Eric Allman, as early as 1980, in the context of ,SCCS,:,[5],
,
,Creating a branch ""forks off"" a version of the program.,
,
,The term was in use on ,Usenet, by 1983 for the process of creating a subgroup to move topics of discussion to.,[6],
,""Fork"" is not known to have been used in the sense of a community schism during the origins of Lucid Emacs (now ,XEmacs,) (1991) or the ,BSDs, (1993–1994); ,Russ Nelson, used the term ""shattering"" for this sort of fork in 1993, attributing it to ,John Gilmore,.,[7], However, ""fork"" was in use in the present sense by 1995 to describe the XEmacs split,,[8], and was an understood usage in the ,GNU, Project by 1996.,[9],
,Forking of free and open source software,[,edit,],
,Free and open source software may be legally forked without prior approval of those currently developing, managing, or distributing the software per both ,The Free Software Definition, and ,The Open Source Definition,:,[10],
,
,The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.,
,— ,The Free Software Definition,[11],
,
,
,3. Derived Works: The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.,
,— ,The Open Source Definition,[12],
,
,In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases, but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the Web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus, there is a reputation penalty associated with forking.,[10], The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter.,
,Eric S. Raymond,, in his essay ,Homesteading the Noosphere,,,[13], stated that ""The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the potential developer community"". He notes in the ,Jargon File,:,[14],
,
,Forking is considered a Bad Thing—not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction. There is serious social pressure against forking. As a result, major forks (such as the ,Gnu-Emacs,/,XEmacs, split, the fissioning of the ,386BSD, group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore.,
,
,David A. Wheeler, notes,[10], four possible outcomes of a fork, with examples:,
,
,The death of the fork. This is by far the most common case. It is easy to declare a fork, but considerable effort to continue independent development and support.,
,A re-merging of the fork (,e.g.,, ,egcs, becoming ""blessed"" as the new version of ,gcc,.),
,The death of the original (,e.g., the ,X.Org Server, succeeding and ,XFree86, dying.),
,Successful branching, typically with differentiation (,e.g.,, ,OpenBSD, and ,NetBSD,.),
,
,Distributed revision control, (DVCS) tools have popularised a less emotive use of the term ""fork"", blurring the distinction with ""branch"".,[15], With a DVCS such as ,Mercurial, or ,Git,, the normal way to contribute to a project, is to first create a personal branch of the repository, independent of the main repository, and later seek to have your changes integrated with it. Sites such as ,GitHub,, ,Bitbucket, and ,Launchpad, provide free DVCS hosting expressly supporting independent branches, such that the technical, social and financial barriers to forking a source code repository are massively reduced, and GitHub uses ""fork"" as its term for this method of contribution to a project.,
,Forks often restart version numbering from 0.1 or 1.0 even if the original software was at version 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0. An exception is when the forked software is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original project, ,e.g., ,MariaDB, for ,MySQL,[16], or ,LibreOffice, for ,OpenOffice.org,.,
,Forking proprietary software,[,edit,],
,In ,proprietary software,, the copyright is usually held by the employing entity, not by the individual software developers. Proprietary code is thus more commonly forked when the owner needs to develop two or more versions, such as a ,windowed, version and a ,command line, version, or versions for differing operating systems, such as a ,word processor, for ,IBM PC, compatible machines and ,Macintosh, computers. Generally, such internal forks will concentrate on having the same look, feel, data format, and behavior between platforms so that a user familiar with one can also be productive or share documents generated on the other. This is almost always an economic decision to generate a greater ,market share, and thus pay back the associated extra development costs created by the fork.,
,A notable proprietary fork not of this kind is the many varieties of proprietary ,Unix,—almost all derived from AT&T Unix under license and all called ""Unix"", but increasingly mutually incompatible.,[17], ,See, ,UNIX wars,.,
,The ,BSD licenses, permit forks to become proprietary software, and some say,[,who?,], that commercial incentives thus make proprietisation almost inevitable. Examples include ,macOS, (based on the proprietary ,NeXTSTEP, and the open source ,FreeBSD,), ,Cedega, and ,CrossOver, (proprietary forks of ,Wine,, though CrossOver tracks Wine and contributes considerably), EnterpriseDB (a fork of ,PostgreSQL,, adding Oracle compatibility features,[18],), Supported PostgreSQL with their proprietary ESM storage system,,[19], and Netezza's,[20], proprietary highly scalable derivative of PostgreSQL. Some of these vendors contribute back changes to the community project, while some keep their changes as their own competitive advantages.,

" 18 October 2017, at 17:23.","In ,software engineering,, the ,active record pattern, is an ,architectural pattern, found in software that stores in-memory object data in ,relational databases,. It was named by ,Martin Fowler, in his 2003 book ,Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture,.,[1], The interface of an object conforming to this pattern would include functions such as Insert, Update, and Delete, plus properties that correspond more or less directly to the columns in the underlying database table.,
,The active record pattern is an approach to accessing data in a ,database,. A ,database table, or ,view, is wrapped into a ,class,. Thus, an ,object, instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object, a new row is added to the table upon save. Any object loaded gets its information from the database. When an object is updated, the corresponding row in the table is also updated. The wrapper class implements ,accessor, ,methods, or properties for each column in the table or view.,
,This pattern is commonly used by object persistence tools and in ,object-relational mapping, (ORM). Typically, ,foreign key, relationships will be exposed as an object instance of the appropriate type via a property.,

,Implementations,[,edit,],
,Implementations of the concept can be found in various ,frameworks, for many programming environments. For example, if in a database there is a table ,parts, with columns ,name, (string type) and ,price, (number type), and the Active Record pattern is implemented in the class ,Part,, the pseudo-code,
,
part = new Part()
part.name = ""Sample part""
part.price = 123.45
part.save()
,
,will create a new row in the ,parts, table with the given values, and is roughly equivalent to the ,SQL, command,
,
,
,INSERT, ,INTO, ,parts, ,(,name,,, ,price,), ,VALUES, ,(,'Sample part',,, ,123,.,45,);,
,
,Conversely, the class can be used to query the database:,
,
b = Part.find_first(""name"", ""gearbox"")
,
,This will find a new ,Part, object based on the first matching row from the ,parts, table whose ,name, column has the value ""gearbox"". The SQL command used might be similar to the following, depending on the SQL implementation details of the database:,
,
,
,SELECT, ,*, ,FROM, ,parts, ,WHERE, ,name, ,=, ,'gearbox', ,LIMIT, ,1,;, ,-- MySQL or PostgreSQL,
,
,ColdFusion,[,edit,],
,ColdFusion, has an open source implementation of the active record pattern.,
,The ,ColdFusion on Wheels, framework has an implementation of the active record pattern. It is open source and has the added advantage of requiring no complex configuration.,
,PHP,[,edit,],
,PHP ActiveRecord is one ,open-source, library designed to fulfill the active record pattern.,[2],
,Several open-source ,PHP, frameworks also bundle their own ,ORM, implementing the active record pattern. Most implementations support relationships, behaviors, ,validation,, ,serialization, and support for multiple data sources.,
,
,Maghead,, a high performance database framework written in pure PHP, contains a class/query method generator to boost the performance. It mixes the active record pattern with repository pattern.,
,Boiler,, an ,MVC, framework for PHP, contains a set of tools for auto-generation of active record models.,[3], The project, designed for data-centered projects, aims to automate as much of the development process as possible,,[4], using ,Apache Ant,. Although a new addition to Open Source market,,[5], the project is already in use in many live applications, both commercially and open. The framework currently only supports ,MySQL, though the developers have reported some commercial work in Postgres.,
,Cygnite PHP Framework,'s default database layer implements Active Record pattern which closely resemble with ,Ruby on Rails,.,[6],
,Laravel, contains an ORM called 'Eloquent' which implements the active record pattern, closely resembling that of ,Ruby on Rails, ,[7],
,CakePHP,'s ORM implements the active record pattern,,[8], but as of version 2.x queries return arrays of data, with levels of ,related data, as required. Version 3.0 uses objects and offers a hybrid implementation of ActiveRecord and Datamapper patterns.,
,Lithium,'s ORM implements active record.,
,Symfony,'s default database layer and ORM "",Doctrine,"" does not implement active record but rather a ,data mapper, approach.,
,CodeIgniter, has a query builder it calls ""ActiveRecord"", but which does not implement the Active Record pattern. Instead, it implements what the user guide refers to as a modified version of the pattern. The Active Record functionality in CodeIgniter can be achieved by using either CodeIgniter DataMapper library or CodeIgniter Gas ORM library.,
,Yii,'s ORM also implements the active record pattern.,[9],
,Propel, also implements the active record pattern.,[10],
,Paris is A lightweight Active Record implementation for PHP5, built on top of Idiorm.,[11],
,
,Ruby,[,edit,],
,The ,Ruby, library ActiveRecord implements ORM. It creates a ,persistable, domain model from business objects and database tables, where logic and data are presented as a unified package. It largely simplifies object-record mapping by assuming homogeneous identification method (i.e. ,Surrogate key,) by virtue of ,convention over configuration,. ActiveRecord adds ,inheritance, and ,associations, to the pattern above, solving two substantial limitations of that pattern. A set of macros acts as a domain language for the latter, and the ,Single Table Inheritance, pattern is integrated for the former; thus, ActiveRecord increases the functionality of the active record pattern approach to database interaction. ActiveRecord is the default ‘model’ component of the ,model-view-controller, web-application framework ,Ruby on Rails,, and is also a stand-alone ORM package for other Ruby applications. In both forms, it was conceived of by ,David Heinemeier Hansson,, and has been improved upon by a number of contributors.,[12],
,Other ORMs have been released since ActiveRecord first appeared. For example, ,DataMapper, and ,Sequel,. These ORMs include improvements over the original ActiveRecord framework.,[,neutrality, is ,disputed,], As a response to their release and adoption by the Rails community, Ruby on Rails v3.0 became independent of an ORM system, so that Rails users can instead use DataMapper or Sequel as their ORM.,
,Python,[,edit,],
,Django,, one of ,Python,'s many web frameworks, uses the Active Record pattern for its ORM.,[13],
,Java,[,edit,],
,The ,Java language, implements the Active Record pattern via the ,ActiveJDBC, library. ActiveJDBC is an implementation of Active Record design pattern inspired by ,Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord. ActiveJDBC is lightweight, fast, small and does not require any configuration.,
,ActiveJPA, and ,jOOQ (for Java Object Oriented Querying), implements the Active record pattern, combining active records with ,source code generation, and a querying DSL similar to ,SQL, allowing for retrieving active records using complex SQL statements.,
,The ,Play framework, is a Java web framework which implements the Active Record pattern, using ideas from ,Ruby on Rails,.,
,JActiveRecord, is yet another library providing easy ,ORM, mapping for Java, inspired by ,Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord but more focused on Java's type-safety.,
,Dart,[,edit,],
,The ,Dart, language implements the Active Record pattern via the ,Dartabase Migration, and ,Dartabase Model, packages,
,Dartabase Migration, Serverside Database Object Models for simple data manipulation currently supporting MySQL/PGSQL inspired by Ruby on Rails Migration,
,Dartabase Model, Serverside Database migration for simple version controlled database structure manipulation currently supporting MySQL/PGSQL inspired by Ruby on Rails Model now console and GUI (build in Polymer 1.0),
,Other languages,[,edit,],
,There are several open source implementations of the Active Record pattern in other languages, including ,JavaScript, (e.g., ,ActiveJS,'s Active Record,[14],), ,Perl, (,DBIx::Class,), ,ActionScript,, ,Haxe, (SPOD,[15],), ,C#,,,[16], ,Objective-C,[17], and ,Scala,.,[18],
,Criticism,[,edit,],
,Testability,[,edit,],
,Due to the coupling of database interaction and application logic when using the active record pattern, unit testing an active record object without a database becomes difficult,[,citation needed,],. The negative effects on testability in the active record pattern can be minimized by using ,mocking, or ,dependency injection, frameworks to substitute the real data tier with a simulated one,[,citation needed,],.,
,Single responsibility principle and separation of concerns,[,edit,],
,Another critique of the active record pattern is that, also due to the strong coupling of database interaction and application logic, an active record object does not follow the ,single responsibility principle, and ,separation of concerns, as opposed to ,multitier architecture, which properly addresses these practices. Because of this, the active record pattern is best and most often employed in simple applications that are all forms-over-data with ,CRUD, functionality, or only as one part of an architecture. Typically that part is data access and why several ORMs implement the active record pattern.,

,In ,software engineering,, ,don't repeat yourself, (,DRY,) is a ,principle, of ,software development, aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing them with abstractions; and several copies of the same data, using ,data normalization, to avoid redundancy.,
,The DRY principle is stated as ""Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"". The principle has been formulated by ,Andy Hunt, and ,Dave Thomas, in their book ,The Pragmatic Programmer,. They apply it quite broadly to include "",database schemas,, ,test plans,, the ,build, system, even ,documentation,"".,[1], When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in ,sync,. Besides using ,methods, and ,subroutines, in their code, Thomas and Hunt rely on ,code generators,, automatic build systems, and ,scripting languages, to observe the DRY principle across layers.,

,DRY vs WET solutions,[,edit,],
,Violations of DRY are typically referred to as WET solutions, which is commonly taken to stand for either ""write everything twice"", ""we enjoy typing"" or ""waste everyone's time"". WET solutions are common in multi-tiered architectures where a developer may be tasked with, for example, adding a comment field on a form in a web application. The text string ""comment"" might be repeated in the label, the HTML tag, in a read function name, a private variable, database DDL, queries, and so on. A DRY approach eliminates that redundancy by leveraging frameworks that reduce or eliminate all those edit tasks excepting the most important one, leaving the extensibility of adding new knowledge variables in one place.,[2],[3],[4],

,Convention over configuration, (also known as ,coding by convention,) is a software ,design paradigm, used by ,software frameworks, that attempt to decrease the number of decisions that a ,developer, using the framework is required to make without necessarily losing flexibility. The concept was introduced by ,David Heinemeier Hansson, to describe the philosophy of the ,Ruby on Rails, ,web framework,, but is related to earlier ideas like the concept of ""sensible ,defaults,"" and the ,principle of least astonishment, in ,user interface design,.,
,The phrase essentially means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class Sales in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called ""sales"" by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as the table ""product sales"", that one needs to write code regarding these names.,
,When the convention implemented by the tool matches the desired behavior, it behaves as expected without having to write configuration files. Only when the desired behavior deviates from the implemented convention is explicit configuration required.,
,Ruby on Rails' use of the phrase is particularly focused on its default project file and directory structure, which prevent developers from having to write ,XML, configuration files to specify which ,modules, the framework should load, which was common in many earlier frameworks.,
,Disadvantages of the convention over configuration approach can occur due to conflicts with other software design principles, like the ,Zen of Python,'s ""explicit is better than implicit."" A ,software framework, based on convention over configuration often involves a ,domain-specific language, with a limited set of constructs or an ,inversion of control, in which the developer can only affect behavior using a limited set of ,hooks,, both of which can make implementing behaviors not easily expressed by the provided conventions more difficult than when using a ,software library, that does not try to decrease the number of decisions developers have to make or require inversion of control.,
,Other methods of decreasing the number of decisions a developer needs to make include ,programming idioms, and configuration libraries with a ,multilayered architecture,.,

,Motivation,[,edit,],
,Some frameworks need multiple configuration files, each with many settings. These provide information specific to each project, ranging from URLs to mappings between classes and database tables. A large number of configuration files with lots of parameters is often difficult to maintain.,
,For example, early versions of the Java persistence mapper ,Hibernate, mapped entities and their fields to the database by describing these relationships in XML files. Most of this information could have been revealed by conventionally mapping class names to the identically named ,database, tables and the fields to their columns, respectively. Later versions did away with the ,XML, configuration file and instead employed these very conventions, deviations from which can be indicated through the use of ,Java annotations, (see JavaBeans specification, linked below).,
,Usage,[,edit,],
,
,
,
,
The ,Maven, software tool auto-generated this directory structure for a Java project.,
,
,
,Many modern frameworks use a ,convention over configuration, approach.,
,The concept is older, however, dating back to the concept of a ,default,, and can be spotted more recently in the roots of ,Java, libraries. For example, the ,JavaBeans, specification relies on it heavily. To quote the ,JavaBeans, specification 1.01:,[1],
,
,""As a general rule we don't want to invent an enormous java.beans.everything class that people have to inherit from. Instead we'd like the ,JavaBeans, runtimes to provide default behaviour for 'normal' objects, but to allow objects to override a given piece of default behaviour by inheriting from some specific java.beans.something interface."",

" 2 January 2018, at 17:20.","In ,software engineering,, a ,software design pattern, is a general, ,reusable, solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in ,software design,. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into ,source, or ,machine code,. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized ,best practices, that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.,
,Object-oriented, design patterns typically show relationships and ,interactions, between ,classes, or ,objects,, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for ,functional programming, languages, some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.,
,Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to ,computer programming, intermediate between the levels of a ,programming paradigm, and a concrete ,algorithm,.,

,History,[,edit,],
,Patterns originated as an ,architectural concept, by ,Christopher Alexander, (1977/79). In 1987, ,Kent Beck, and ,Ward Cunningham, began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically ,pattern languages, – and presented their results at the ,OOPSLA, conference that year.,[1],[2], In the following years, Beck, Cunningham and others followed up on this work.,
,Design patterns gained popularity in ,computer science, after the book ,Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, was published in 1994 by the so-called ""Gang of Four"" (Gamma et al.), which is frequently abbreviated as ""GoF"". That same year, the first ,Pattern Languages of Programming, Conference was held and the following year, the ,Portland Pattern Repository, was set up for documentation of design patterns. The scope of the term remains a matter of dispute. Notable books in the design pattern genre include:,

,Although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time, formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years.,[3],
,Practice,[,edit,],
,Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.,[4], Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems,[,citation needed,],, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.,
,In order to achieve flexibility, design patterns usually introduce additional levels of ,indirection,, which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance.,
,By definition, a pattern must be programmed anew into each application that uses it. Since some authors see this as a step backward from ,software reuse, as provided by ,components,, researchers have worked to turn patterns into components. Meyer and Arnout were able to provide full or partial componentization of two-thirds of the patterns they attempted.,[5],
,Software design techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems.,[,citation needed,], Design patterns provide general solutions, ,documented, in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem.,
,Structure,[,edit,],
,Design patterns are composed of several sections (see ,§ Documentation, below). Of particular interest are the Structure, Participants, and Collaboration sections. These sections describe a ,design motif,: a prototypical ,micro-architecture, that developers copy and adapt to their particular designs to solve the recurrent problem described by the design pattern. A micro-architecture is a set of program constituents (e.g., classes, methods...) and their relationships. Developers use the design pattern by introducing in their designs this prototypical micro-architecture, which means that micro-architectures in their designs will have structure and organization similar to the chosen design motif.,
,Domain-specific patterns,[,edit,],
,Efforts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains, including use of existing design patterns as well as domain specific design patterns. Examples include ,user interface, design patterns,,[6], ,information visualization,,,[7], secure design,,[8], ""secure usability"",,[9], Web design ,[10], and business model design.,[11],
,The annual ,Pattern Languages of Programming, Conference proceedings ,[12], include many examples of domain-specific patterns.,

,Design patterns were originally grouped into the categories: ,creational patterns,, ,structural patterns,, and ,behavioral patterns,, and described using the concepts of ,delegation,, ,aggregation,, and consultation. For further background on object-oriented design, see ,coupling, and ,cohesion,, ,inheritance,, ,interface,, and ,polymorphism,. Another classification has also introduced the notion of ,architectural design pattern, that may be applied at the architecture level of the software such as the ,Model–View–Controller, pattern.,

,Documentation,[,edit,],
,The documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used, the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve, and the suggested solution.,[24], There is no single, standard format for documenting design patterns. Rather, a variety of different formats have been used by different pattern authors. However, according to ,Martin Fowler,, certain pattern forms have become more well-known than others, and consequently become common starting points for new pattern-writing efforts.,[25], One example of a commonly used documentation format is the one used by ,Erich Gamma,, ,Richard Helm,, ,Ralph Johnson, and ,John Vlissides, (collectively known as the ""Gang of Four"", or GoF for short) in their book ,Design Patterns,. It contains the following sections:,
,
,Pattern Name and Classification:, A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying and referring to the pattern.,
,Intent:, A description of the goal behind the pattern and the reason for using it.,
,Also Known As:, Other names for the pattern.,
,Motivation (Forces):, A scenario consisting of a problem and a context in which this pattern can be used.,
,Applicability:, Situations in which this pattern is usable; the context for the pattern.,
,Structure:, A graphical representation of the pattern. ,Class diagrams, and ,Interaction diagrams, may be used for this purpose.,
,Participants:, A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design.,
,Collaboration:, A description of how classes and objects used in the pattern interact with each other.,
,Consequences:, A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern.,
,Implementation:, A description of an implementation of the pattern; the solution part of the pattern.,
,Sample Code:, An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language.,
,Known Uses:, Examples of real usages of the pattern.,
,Related Patterns:, Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns.,
,
,Criticism,[,edit,],
,The concept of design patterns has been criticized in several ways.,
,The design patterns may just be a sign of some missing features of a given programming language (,Java, or ,C++, for instance). ,Peter Norvig, demonstrates that 16 out of the 23 patterns in the ,Design Patterns, book (which is primarily focused on C++) are simplified or eliminated (via direct language support) in ,Lisp, or ,Dylan,.,[26], Related observations were made by Hannemann and Kiczales who implemented several of the 23 design patterns using an ,aspect-oriented programming language, (AspectJ) and showed that code-level dependencies were removed from the implementations of 17 of the 23 design patterns and that aspect-oriented programming could simplify the implementations of design patterns.,[27], See also ,Paul Graham's, essay ""Revenge of the Nerds"".,[28],
,Moreover, inappropriate use of patterns may unnecessarily increase complexity.,[29],
,Another point of criticism is the lack of an update version since the ,Design Patterns, book was published in 1994.,

,Definitions,[,edit,],
,Notable definitions of software engineering include:,
,
,""the systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software""—The Bureau of Labor Statistics—,IEEE, ,Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary,[4],
,""The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of ,software,""—,IEEE, ,Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology,[5],
,""an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production""—,Ian Sommerville,[6],
,""the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines""—,Fritz Bauer,[7],
,
,The term has also been used less formally:,
,
,as the informal contemporary term for the broad range of activities that were formerly called ,computer programming, and ,systems analysis,;,[8],
,as the broad term for all aspects of the ,practice, of computer programming, as opposed to the ,theory, of computer programming, which is called ,computer science,;,[9],
,as the term embodying the ,advocacy, of a specific approach to computer programming, one that urges that it be treated as an ,engineering, discipline rather than an art or a craft, and advocates the codification of recommended practices.,[10],
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,History of software engineering,
,When the first digital ,computers, appeared in the early 1940s,,[11], the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine. Practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible and came up with the ""stored program architecture"" or ,von Neumann architecture,. Thus the division between ""hardware"" and ""software"" began with ,abstraction, being used to deal with the complexity of computing.,
,Programming languages, started to appear in the early 1950s,[12], and this was also another major step in abstraction. Major languages such as ,Fortran,, ,ALGOL,, and ,COBOL, were released in the late 1950s to deal with scientific, algorithmic, and business problems respectively. ,David Parnas, introduced the key concept of ,modularity, and ,information hiding, in 1972,[13], to help programmers deal with the ever-increasing complexity of ,software systems,.,
,The origins of the term ""software engineering"" have been attributed to different sources. The term ""software engineering"" was used in the August 1966 issue of Communications of the ACM (Volume 9, number 8) “letter to the ACM membership” by the ACM President Anthony A. Oettinger;,[14], it is also commonly associated with the title of a seminal NATO conference in 1968 by Professor F.L. Bauer, the first conference on software engineering.,[15], At the time there was perceived to be a "",software crisis,"".,[16],[17],[18],
,In 1984, the ,Software Engineering Institute, (SEI) was established as a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. ,Watts Humphrey, founded the SEI Software Process Program, aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering process. The Process Maturity Levels introduced would become the Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development(CMMi-DEV), which has defined how the US Government evaluates the abilities of a software development team.,
,Modern, generally accepted best-practices for software engineering have been collected by the ,ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7, subcommittee and published as the ,Software Engineering Body of Knowledge, (SWEBOK).,[19],
,Subdisciplines,[,edit,],
,Software engineering can be divided into sub-disciplines.,[20], Some of them are:,
,
,Software requirements,[1],[20], (or ,Requirements engineering,): The elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of ,requirements, for ,software,.,
,Software design,:,[1],[20], The process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component. It is also defined as the result of that process.,
,Software construction,:,[1],[20], The detailed creation of working, meaningful software through a combination of ,programming, (aka coding), verification, ,unit testing,, ,integration testing,, and ,debugging,.,
,Software testing,:,[1],[20], An empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.,
,Software maintenance,:,[1],[20], The totality of activities required to provide cost-effective support to software.,
,Software configuration management,:,[1],[20], The identification of the configuration of a system at distinct points in time for the purpose of systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration throughout the system life cycle. Modern processes use ,software versioning,.,
,Software engineering management,:,[1],[20], The application of management activities—planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting—to ensure that the development and maintenance of software is systematic, disciplined, and quantified.,
,Software development process,:,[1],[20], The definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself.,
,Software engineering models and methods,[20], impose structure on software engineering with the goal of making that activity systematic, repeatable, and ultimately more success-oriented,
,Software quality,[20],
,Software engineering professional practice,[20], is concerned with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that software engineers must possess to practice software engineering in a professional, responsible, and ethical manner,
,Software engineering economics,[20], is about making decisions related to software engineering in a business context,
,Computing foundations,[20],
,Mathematical foundations,[20],
,Engineering foundations,[20],
,
,Education,[,edit,],
,Knowledge of ,computer programming, is a prerequisite for becoming a software engineer. In 2004 the ,IEEE Computer Society, produced the ,SWEBOK,, which has been published as ISO/IEC Technical Report 1979:2004, describing the body of knowledge that they recommend to be mastered by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience.,[21], Many software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school. One standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the ,CCSE,, and updated in 2004.,[22], A number of universities have Software Engineering degree programs; as of 2010,[update],, there were 244 Campus ,Bachelor of Software Engineering, programs, 70 Online programs, 230 Masters-level programs, 41 Doctorate-level programs, and 69 Certificate-level programs in the United States.,[23],
,In addition to university education, many companies sponsor internships for students wishing to pursue careers in information technology. These internships can introduce the student to interesting real-world tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day. Similar experience can be gained through ,military service, in software engineering.,
,Profession,[,edit,],
,Main articles: ,Software engineer, and ,Software engineering professionalism,
,Legal requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world. In the UK, there is no licensing or legal requirement to assume or use the job title Software Engineer. In some areas of Canada, such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario,,[24], and Quebec, software engineers can hold the Professional Engineer (P.Eng) designation and/or the Information Systems Professional (I.S.P.) designation. In Canada, there is a legal requirement to have P.Eng when one wants to use the title ""engineer"" or practice ""software engineering"". In Europe, Software Engineers can obtain the ,European Engineer, (EUR ING) professional title.,
,The United States, since 2013, has offered an ,NCEES, ,Professional Engineer, exam for Software Engineering, thereby allowing Software Engineers to be licensed and recognized.,[25], Mandatory licensing is currently still largely debated, and perceived as controversial. In some parts of the US such as Texas, the use of the term ,Engineer, is regulated by law and reserved only for use by individuals who have a ,Professional Engineer, license.,
,The ,IEEE Computer Society, and the ,ACM,, the two main US-based professional organizations of software engineering, publish guides to the profession of software engineering. The IEEE's ,Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge - 2004 Version,, or ,SWEBOK,, defines the field and describes the knowledge the IEEE expects a practicing software engineer to have. The most current SWEBOK v3 is an updated version and was released in 2014.,[26], The IEEE also promulgates a ""Software Engineering Code of Ethics"".,[27],
,Employment,[,edit,],
,In November 2004, the ,U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, counted 760,840 software engineers holding jobs in the ,U.S.,; in the same time period there were some 1.4 million practitioners employed in the U.S. in all other engineering disciplines combined.,[28], Due to its relative newness as a field of study, formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum, and many software engineers hold computer science degrees and have no engineering background whatsoever.,[29],
,Many software engineers work as employees or contractors. Software engineers work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as ,freelancers,. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the ,software development process,. Other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. Specializations include: in industry (,analysts,, ,architects,, ,developers,, ,testers,, ,technical support,, ,middleware analysts,, ,managers,) and in academia (,educators,, ,researchers,).,
,Most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week, but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008. Injuries in these occupations are rare. However, like other workers who spend long periods in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard, engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems such as ,carpal tunnel syndrome,.,[30],
,The field's future looks bright according to ,Money Magazine, and ,Salary.com,, which rated Software Engineer as the best job in the United States in 2006.,[31], In 2012, software engineering was again ranked as the best job in the United States, this time by CareerCast.com.,[32],
,Certification,[,edit,],
,The ,Software Engineering Institute, offers certifications on specific topics like ,security,, process improvement and ,software architecture,.,[33], ,Apple,, ,IBM,, ,Microsoft, and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations. Many ,IT, ,certification, programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and managed by the vendors of these technologies.,[34], These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.,
,Broader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies. As of 2006,[update],, the ,IEEE, had certified over 575 software professionals as a ,Certified Software Development Professional, (CSDP).,[35], In 2008 they added an entry-level certification known as the Certified Software Development Associate (CSDA).,[36], The ,ACM, had a professional certification program in the early 1980s,,[,citation needed,], which was discontinued due to lack of interest. The ACM examined the possibility of professional certification of software engineers in the late 1990s, but eventually decided that such certification was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering.,[37],
,In the U.K. the ,British Computer Society, has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ,Chartered IT Professional (CITP),, available to fully qualified members (,MBCS,). Software engineers may be eligible for membership of the ,Institution of Engineering and Technology, and so qualify for Chartered Engineer status. In Canada the ,Canadian Information Processing Society, has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ,Information Systems Professional (ISP),.,[38], In Ontario, Canada, Software Engineers who graduate from a ,Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), accredited program, successfully complete PEO's (,Professional Engineers Ontario,) Professional Practice Examination (PPE) and have at least 48 months of acceptable engineering experience are eligible to be licensed through the ,Professional Engineers Ontario, and can become Professional Engineers P.Eng.,[39], The PEO does not recognize any online or distance education however; and does not consider Computer Science programs to be equivalent to software engineering programs despite the tremendous overlap between the two. This has sparked controversy and a certification war. It has also held the number of P.Eng holders for the profession exceptionally low. The vast majority of working professionals in the field hold a degree in CS, not SE. Given the difficult certification path for holders of non-SE degrees, most never bother to pursue the license.,
,Impact of globalization,[,edit,],
,The initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries. This approach had some flaws, mainly the distance / timezone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer. This had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the ,developed world, avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of ,offshore outsourcing, (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by ,foreign visa workers,.,[40], Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, ,computer programming, does appear to have been affected.,[41],[42], Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources via the ,follow-the-sun, workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations.,[43], When North Americans are leaving work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans are arriving to work. This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource, sleep patterns.,
,While global outsourcing has several advantages, global - and generally distributed - development can run into serious difficulties resulting from the distance between developers. This is due to the key elements of this type of distance that have been identified as geographical, temporal, cultural and communication (that includes the use of different languages and dialects of English in different locations).,[44], Research has been carried out in the area of global software development over the last 15 years and an extensive body of relevant work published that highlights the benefits and problems associated with the complex activity. As with other aspects of software engineering research is ongoing in this and related areas.,
,Related fields,[,edit,],
,Software engineering is a direct sub-field of ,engineering, and has an overlap with ,computer science, and ,management science,[,citation needed,],. It is also considered a part of overall ,systems engineering,.,

,In general, software engineering focuses more on techniques for the application of software development in industry,,[45],[46], while computer science focuses more on algorithms and theory.,[47],
,Controversy,[,edit,],
,Criticism,[,edit,],
,Software engineering sees its practitioners as individuals who follow well-defined engineering approaches to problem-solving. These approaches are specified in various software engineering books and research papers, always with the connotations of predictability, precision, mitigated risk and professionalism. This perspective has led to calls for licensing, certification and codified bodies of knowledge as mechanisms for spreading the engineering knowledge and maturing the field.,
,Software craftsmanship, has been proposed by a body of software developers as an alternative that emphasizes the coding skills and accountability of the software developers themselves without professionalism or any prescribed curriculum leading to ad-hoc problem-solving (craftmanship) without engineering (lack of predictability, precision, missing risk mitigation, methods are informal and poorly defined). ,The Software Craftsmanship Manifesto, extends the Agile Software Manifesto,[48], and draws a metaphor between modern software development and the apprenticeship model of medieval Europe.,
,Software engineering extends engineering and draws on the engineering model, i.e. engineering process, engineering project management, engineering requirements, engineering design, engineering construction, and engineering validation. The concept is so new that it is rarely understood, and it is widely misinterpreted, including in software engineering textbooks, papers, and among the communities of programmers and crafters.,
,One of the core issues in software engineering is that its approaches are not empirical enough because a real-world validation of approaches is usually absent, or very limited and hence software engineering is often misinterpreted as feasible only in a ""theoretical environment."",
,Dijkstra, who developed computer languages in the 20th century refuted the concepts of ""software engineering"" that was prevalent in the 1980s, arguing that those terms were poor analogies for what he called the ""radical novelty"" of ,computer science,:,
,
,A number of these phenomena have been bundled under the name ""Software Engineering"". As economics is known as ""The Miserable Science"", software engineering should be known as ""The Doomed Discipline"", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory. Software engineering, of course, presents itself as another worthy cause, but that is eyewash: if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do, you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter ""How to program if you cannot."",[49],

,Sass, (Syntactically awesome style sheets) is a ,style sheet language, initially designed by ,Hampton Catlin, and developed by ,Natalie Weizenbaum,.,[2],[3], After its initial versions, Weizenbaum and ,Chris Eppstein, continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a simple scripting language used in Sass files.,
,Sass is a ,scripting language, that is ,interpreted, or ,compiled, into ,Cascading Style Sheets, (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two ,syntaxes,. The original syntax, called ""the indented syntax"", uses a syntax similar to ,Haml,.,[4], It uses ,indentation, to separate ,code blocks, and ,newline, characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, ""SCSS"", uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the ,extensions, .sass and .scss, respectively.,
,CSS3, consists of a series of selectors and pseudo-selectors that group rules that apply to them. Sass,[5], (in the larger context of both syntaxes) extends CSS by providing several mechanisms available in more traditional ,programming languages,, particularly ,object-oriented languages,, but that are not available to CSS3 itself. When SassScript is interpreted, it creates blocks of CSS rules for various selectors as defined by the Sass file. The Sass interpreter translates SassScript into CSS. Alternatively, Sass can monitor the .sass or .scss file and translate it to an output .css file whenever the .sass or .scss file is saved.,[6], Sass is simply ,syntactic sugar, for CSS.,
,The official implementation of Sass is ,open-source, and coded in ,Ruby,; however, other implementations exist, including ,Dart,, ,PHP,, and a high-performance implementation in ,C, called libSass.,[7],[8], There's also a ,Java, implementation called JSass.,[9], Additionally, ,Vaadin, has a Java implementation of Sass.,[10], The indented syntax is a metalanguage. SCSS is a ,nested metalanguage,, as valid CSS is valid SCSS with the same ,semantics,. Sass supports integration with the ,Firefox, ,extension, ,Firebug,.,[11],
,SassScript provides the following mechanisms: ,variables,, ,nesting,, ,mixins,, and selector ,inheritance,.,[4],

,
,Variables,[,edit,],
,Sass allows variables to be defined. Variables begin with a ,dollar sign, (,$,). Variable ,assignment, is done with a ,colon, (,:,).,[11],
,SassScript supports four data types:,[11],
,
,Numbers, (including units),
,Strings, (with quotes or without),
,Colors (name, or names),
,Booleans,
,
,Variables can be ,arguments, to or results from one of several available ,functions,.,[12], During translation, the values of the variables are inserted into the output CSS document.,[4],

,},

,.,border, ,{,
  ,padding,:, ,8,px,;,
  ,margin,:, ,8,px,;,
  ,border-color,:, ,#3bbfce,;,
,},
,
,Nesting,[,edit,],
,CSS does support logical nesting, but the code blocks themselves are not nested. Sass allows the nested code to be inserted within each other.,[4],
,In Sass style,
,
,
,table,.hl, 
  ,margin,:, ,2,em, ,0,
  ,td,.ln, 
    ,text-align,:, ,right,
  
,li, 
  ,font,:, 
    ,family,:, ,serif,
    ,weight,:, ,bold,

,
,Would compile to:,
,

,},
,table,.,hl, ,td,.,ln, ,{,

,},

,li, ,{,
  ,font-family,:, ,serif,;,
  ,font-weight,:, ,bold,;,
  ,font-size,:, ,1.3,em,;,
,},
,
,More complicated types of nesting including ,namespace, nesting and parent references are discussed in the Sass documentation.,[11],
,

    ,font-weight,:, ,bold,
  ,td,,, ,th,

,},
,#,data, ,td,,, ,#,data, ,th, ,{,

,
,Loops,[,edit,],
,Sass allows for iterating over variables using ,@for,, ,@each, and ,@while,, which can be used to apply different styles to elements with similar classes or ids.,
,
,
,$squareCount,:, ,3,
,@for, ,$i, ,from, ,1, ,through, ,$squareCount, 
  ,#square-,#{,$i,}, 
   ,background-color,:, ,red,
   ,width,:, ,50,px, ,*, ,$i,
   ,height,:, ,120,px, ,/, ,$i,
,
,The above example would compile to:,
,
,
,#,square-1, ,{,
  ,background-color,:, ,red,;,
  ,width,:, ,50,px,;,
  ,height,:, ,120,px,;,
,},

,#,square-2, ,{,
  ,background-color,:, ,red,;,
  ,width,:, ,100,px,;,
  ,height,:, ,60,px,;,
,},

,#,square-3, ,{,
  ,background-color,:, ,red,;,
  ,width,:, ,150,px,;,
  ,height,:, ,40,px,;,
,},
,
,Arguments,[,edit,],
,Mixins also support arguments.,[4],
,
,
,=left,(,$dist,), 
  ,float,:, ,left,
  ,margin-left,:, ,$dist,

,#data, 
  ,+left,(,10,px,),
,
,Would compile to:,
,
,
,#,data, ,{,
  ,float,:, ,left,;,
  ,margin-left,:, ,10,px,;,
,},
,
,In combination,[,edit,],
,
,
,=table-base,
  ,th,
    ,text-align,:, ,center,
    ,font-weight,:, ,bold,
  ,td,,, ,th, 
    ,padding,:, ,2,px,

,=left,(,$dist,), 
  ,float,:, ,left,
  ,margin-left,:, ,$dist,

,#data, 
  ,+left,(,10,px,),
  ,+table-base,
,
,Would compile to:,
,
,
,#,data, ,{,

  ,text-align,:, ,center,;,
  ,font-weight,:, ,bold,;,
,},
,#,data, ,td,,, ,#,data, ,th, ,{,
  ,padding,:, ,2,px,;,
,},
,
,Selector inheritance,[,edit,],
,While CSS3 supports the ,Document Object Model, (DOM) hierarchy, it does not allow selector inheritance. In Sass, inheritance is achieved by inserting a line inside of a code block that uses the @extend keyword and references another selector. The extended selector's attributes are applied to the calling selector.,[4],
,
,
,.error,
  ,border,:, ,1,px, ,#f00,
  ,background,:, ,#fdd,

,.error.intrusion, 
  ,font-size,:, ,1,.3,em,
  ,font-weight,:, ,bold,

,.badError, 
  ,@extend, ,.error,
  ,border-width,:, ,3,px,
,
,Would compile to:,
,
,
,.,error,,, ,.,badError, ,{,

  ,font-size,:, ,1.3,em,;,
  ,font-weight,:, ,bold,;,
,},

,.,badError, ,{,
  ,border-width,:, ,3,px,;,
,},
,
,Sass supports ,multiple inheritance,.,[11],
,libSass,[,edit,],
,At the 2012 HTML5 Developer Conference, Hampton Catlin, the creator of Sass, announced version 1.0 of libSass, an open source C++ implementation of Sass developed by Catlin, Aaron Leung, and the engineering team at ,Moovweb,.,[8],[13], Current Sass maintainer, Chris Eppstein, has expressed intent to contribute as well.,[14],
,According to Catlin, libSass can be ""drop[ped] into anything and it will have Sass in it...You could drop it right into Firefox today and build Firefox and it will compile in there. We wrote our own parser from scratch to make sure that would be possible."",[15],
,The design goals of libSass are:,
,
,Performance – Developers have reported 10x speed up increases over the Ruby implementation of Sass.,[16],
,Easier integration – libSass makes it easier to integrate Sass into more software. Before libSass, tightly integrating Sass into a language or software product required bundling the entire Ruby interpreter. By contrast, libSass is a statically linkable library with zero external dependencies and C-like interface, making it easy to wrap Sass directly into other programming languages and tools. For example, open source libSass bindings now exist for ,Node,, ,Go,, and ,Ruby,.,[13],
,Compatibility – libSass's goal is full compatibility with the official Ruby implementation of Sass; however, this goal has not yet been fully met.,[8],

,CoffeeScript, is a programming language that ,transcompiles, to ,JavaScript,. It adds ,syntactic sugar, inspired by ,Ruby,, ,Python, and ,Haskell, in an effort to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability.,[3], Specific additional features include ,list comprehension, and ,pattern matching,.,
,CoffeeScript support is included in ,Ruby on Rails, version 3.1,[4], and ,Play Framework,.,[5], In 2011, ,Brendan Eich, referenced CoffeeScript as an influence on his thoughts about the future of JavaScript.,[6],[7],

,History,[,edit,],
,On December 13, 2009, ,Jeremy Ashkenas, made the first ,Git, commit of CoffeeScript with the comment: ""initial commit of the mystery language."",[8], The compiler was written in Ruby. On December 24, he made the first tagged and documented release, 0.1.0. On February 21, 2010, he committed version 0.5, which replaced the Ruby compiler with a ,self-hosting, version in pure CoffeeScript. By that time the project had attracted several other contributors on ,GitHub,, and was receiving over 300 page hits per day.,
,On December 24, 2010, Ashkenas announced the release of stable 1.0.0 to ,Hacker News,, the site where the project was announced for the first time.,[9],[10],
,Syntax,[,edit,],
,Almost everything is an expression in CoffeeScript, for example ,if,, ,switch, and ,for, expressions (which have no return value in JavaScript) return a value. As in ,Perl,, these control statements also have postfix versions; for example, ,if, can also be written after the conditional statement.,
,Many unnecessary parentheses and braces can be omitted; for example, blocks of code can be denoted by indentation instead of braces, function calls are implicit, and object literals are often detected automatically.,
,Examples,[,edit,],
,Interval test,[,edit,],
,To compute the ,body mass index,, one may do (here in ,JavaScript,):,
,
,
,var, ,mass, ,=, ,72,;,
,var, ,height, ,=, ,1.78,;,
,var, ,BMI, ,=, ,mass, ,/, ,Math,.,pow,(,height,,, ,2,);,
,if, ,(,18.5, ,<, ,BMI, ,&&, ,BMI, ,<, ,25,), ,alert,(,'You are healthy!',);,
,
,With CoffeeScript the interval is directly described:,
,
,
,mass = ,72,
,height = ,1.78,
,BMI = ,mass, ,/, ,height,**,2,
,alert, ,'You are healthy!', ,if, ,18.5, ,<, ,BMI, ,<, ,25,
,
,Loops and comprehensions,[,edit,],
,To compute the ,greatest common divisor, of two integers with the ,euclidean algorithm,, in JavaScript one usually needs a ,while, loop:,
,
,
,gcd, ,=, ,(,x,,, ,y,), ,=>, ,{,
  ,do, ,{,
    ,z, ,=, ,x, ,%, ,y,
    ,x, ,=, ,y,
    ,y, ,=, ,z,
  ,}, ,while, ,(,y, ,!==, ,0,),
  ,return, ,x,
,},
,
,Whereas in CoffeeScript one can use ,until, and pattern-matching instead:,
,
,
,gcd = ,(x, y) ->,
  ,[,x,,, ,y,], ,=, ,[,y,,, ,x,%,y,], ,until, ,y, ,is, ,0,
  ,x,
,
,Any ,for, loop can be replaced by a ,list comprehension,; so that to compute the squares of the positive odd numbers smaller than ten (i.e. numbers which remainder modulo 2 is 1), one can do:,
,
,
,alert, ,n,*,n, ,for, ,n, ,in, ,[,1,..,10,], ,when, ,n,%,2, ,is, ,1,
,
,Alternatively, there is:,
,
,
,alert, ,n,*,n, ,for, ,n, ,in, ,[,1,..,10,], ,by, ,2,
,
,A ,linear search, can be implemented with a one-liner using the when keyword:,
,
,
,names = ,[,""Ivan"",,, ,""Joanna"",,, ,""Nikolay"",,, ,""Mihaela"",],
,linearSearch = ,(searchName) ->, ,alert,(,name,), ,for, ,name, ,in, ,names, ,when, ,name, ,is, ,searchName,
,
,The ,for ... in, syntax allows looping over arrays while the ,for ... of, syntax allows looping over objects.,
,The ,?, keyword quickly checks if a variable is ,null, or ,undefined, :,
,
,
,personCheck = ,->,
  ,if, ,not, ,person,?, ,then, ,alert,(,""No person"",), ,else, ,alert,(,""Have person"",),
,person = ,null,
,personCheck,(),
,person = ,""Ivan"",
,personCheck,(),
,
,This would alert ""No person"" if the variable is ,null, or ,undefined, and ""Have person"" if there is something there.,
,Functions and jQuery,[,edit,],
,A common JavaScript snippet using the ,jQuery, library is:,
,
,
,$,(,document,).,ready,(,function,(), ,{,
  ,// Initialization code goes here,
,}),
,
,Or even just:,
,
,
,$,(,function,(), ,{,
  ,// Initialization code goes here,
,}),
,
,In CoffeeScript, the ,function, keyword is replaced by the ,->, symbol, and indentation is used instead of curly braces, as in other ,off-side rule, languages such as Python and Haskell. Also, parentheses can usually be omitted, using indentation level instead to denote a function or block. Thus, the CoffeeScript equivalent of the snippet above is:,
,
,
,$,(,document,).,ready, ,->,
  ,# Initialization code goes here,
,
,Or just:,
,
,
,$, ,->,
  ,# Initialization code goes here,
,
,String interpolation,[,edit,],
,Ruby-style string interpolation is included in CoffeeScript. Double-quoted strings allow for interpolated values, using #{ ... }, and single-quoted strings are literal.,[11],
,
,
,author = ,""Wittgenstein"",
,quote  = ,""A picture is a fact. -- ,#{, ,author, ,},"",

,sentence = ,"",#{, ,22, ,/, ,7, ,}, is a decent approximation of π"",
,
,Compiling,[,edit,],
,The CoffeeScript compiler has been ,written in CoffeeScript, since version 0.5 and is available as a ,Node.js, utility; however, the core compiler does not rely on Node.js and can be run in any ,JavaScript, environment.,[12], One alternative to the ,Node.js, utility is the ,Coffee Maven Plugin,, a plugin for the popular ,Apache Maven, build system. The plugin uses the ,Rhino, JavaScript engine written in ,Java,.,
,The official site at CoffeeScript.org has a ""Try CoffeeScript"" button in the menu bar; clicking it opens a modal window in which users can enter CoffeeScript, see the JavaScript output, and run it directly in the browser. The js2coffee,[13], site provides bi-directional translation.,
,Latest additions,[,edit,],
,
,Source maps allow users to de-bug their CoffeeScript code directly, supporting CoffeeScript tracebacks on run time errors.,
,CoffeeScript supports a form of ,Literate Programming,, using the ,.coffee.md, or ,.litcoffee, file extension. This allows CoffeeScript source code to be written in ,Markdown,. The compiler will treat any indented blocks (Markdown's way of indicating source code) as code, and ignore the rest as comments.,
,
,Adoption,[,edit,],
,On September 13, 2012, ,Dropbox, announced that their browser-side code base has been rewritten from ,JavaScript, to CoffeeScript.,[14],
,GitHub,'s internal style guide once said ""write new JS in CoffeeScript"", and while it no longer does, all the advice in the style guide references how to write good CoffeeScript,,[15], and their ,Atom text editor, is also written in the language.,[16],

,IBM i, is an ,operating system, that runs on ,IBM Power Systems, and on IBM ,PureSystems,. It was named ,OS/400, when it was introduced with the ,AS/400, line of computer systems in 1988, was later renamed to ,i5/OS,, and was renamed to IBM i in 2008 when the IBM Power Systems were introduced.,
,It is one of the operating systems supported on IBM Power Systems alongside ,AIX, and ,Linux, as well as on IBM PureSystems alongside AIX, Linux and ,Windows,.,

,History,[,edit,],
,The early ,IBM System/36, and ,IBM System/38, series customers were a key target of the AS/400, so OS/400 (and its descendants i5/OS and IBM i), have built-in subsystems that provide backward compatibility with these earlier IBM general business systems. IBM i programs, like System/38 programs before them, contain both processor-independent ""virtual"" binary code and processor-dependent executable binary code. Compilers for IBM i produce the processor-independent code as their output; the operating system automatically translates the processor-independent code into the processor-dependent code as needed, without the need for source code or attention by IT personnel. Notably, when migrating from a legacy processor, the only effect that most organizations notice is that the program runs somewhat longer when it runs for the first time on the new computer. Migration consists of taking a backup from the old computer, and restoring it on the new.,[1],
,Features,[,edit,],
,IBM designed IBM i as a "",turnkey,"" operating system, requiring little or no on-site attention from IT staff during normal operation. For example, IBM i has a built-in ,DB2, database which does not require separate installation. Disks are multiply redundant, and can be replaced on line without interrupting work. Hardware and software maintenance tasks are integrated. System administration has been ,wizard,-driven for years, even before that term was defined. This automatic self-care policy goes so far as to automatically schedule all common system maintenance, detect many failures and even order spare parts and service automatically. Organizations using i sometimes have ,sticker shock, when confronting the cost of system maintenance on other systems.,[1],
,Another peculiar feature is that this system was one of the earliest to be ,object-based,. Unlike traditional OSes like UNIX and Windows NT there are no files, only objects of different types. It implemented one of the earliest-known systems for persistent objects. Further, the objects persist in very large, flat virtual memory, called a ,single-level store,.,[1],
,The IBM i Access licensed product includes ,iSeries Navigator,, a client-based and web-based graphical tool for administration of the system, database, ,Apache web server,, and ,WebSphere Application Server,. IBM Systems Director Navigator for i now can be used to manage target servers running IBM i 5.4, 6.1 or 7.1 from a single browser environment with the IBM i 7.1.,
,In 1999, IBM introduced ,logical partitioning (LPARs), with i5/OS to support multiple virtual systems on a single hardware footprint.,
,In 2007, IBM and ,MySQL AB, ,announced a joint technology and reseller agreement, to bring support for the ,MySQL, open source database and ,DB2 for i as a certified MySQL storage engine, to the IBM i platform, which was ,later in 2011 dropped, by ,MySQL AB,.,
,In 2011, IBM and ,Zend Technologies, announced ,Zend DBi, as replacement for the ,MySQL on IBM i support, with a first ,General availability release, in 2012.,
,In 2013, IBM and ,PowerRuby Inc., announced ,PowerRuby, as a commercially supported port of the ,Ruby programming language, and the ,Ruby on Rails, ,Web application framework, for IBM i. ,PowerRuby, will be offered as a free download to be installed on customer machines.,
,In 2014, IBM ported ,Node.js, to IBM i.,[2],
,PASE,[,edit,],
,IBM i also provides an environment for ,AIX, applications to run natively on the OS without the need for an AIX LPAR.,[3],
,AIX programs are binary compatible with IBM i when using its PASE (Portable Applications System Environment). PASE is essentially ""an operating system within an operating system"", supporting the most recent stable version of AIX. Most AIX 5L compatible binaries may be executed without modification or recompilation in the PASE environment. Exceptions to this are programs that contain direct calls to AIX kernel based APIs as there is no AIX kernel in PASE. If necessary an AIX program may be built directly in PASE using a standard AIX XL C/C++ compiler, for example if native APIs are to be used. In that case APIs are provided to translate between the AIX style pointers and the native 16 byte pointers. Support is provided for running both 32-bit and 64-bit AIX executables.,
,Version,[,edit,],
,When IBM announced the new Power Systems line of servers on April 2, 2008, they renamed the operating system from i5/OS to IBM i,[4], and changed the version identifier format from VxRxMx (Version, Release, Modification, e.g. V6R1M0) to the more standard format (e.g. 6.1).,
,The latest version of IBM i is 7.3, announced on April 12, 2016 and released on April 15, 2016 (,Version Support Schedule,).,
,With 7.1, IBM started delivering new updates to the operating system via Technology Refreshes, where number 10 was released in May 2015.,
,Version 7.2 was released in May 2014.,[5],
,Version 7.3 was released in April 2016.,[6],

,
,User groups,[,edit,],
,User groups have played a major part in the evolution of the IBM i. The largest such group is ,COMMON,.,[7], The Large User Group (LUG),,[8], whose membership consists of major corporations, is a major influence for current and future development of IBM i. The ,Young i Professionals, (YIPS),[9], is another group that has been significant in influencing the direction of the IBM i.,

,mod_ruby, is a module that ,embeds, the ,Ruby, ,interpreter, into the ,Apache web server, to allow Ruby code to execute natively, faster than other ,CGI, methods. Its drawback is that the characteristic sharing of classes among Apache processes is not safe for multiple applications,[1], (e.g., multiple ,Ruby on Rails, applications running simultaneously).,
,There is also the similar ,mod_mruby, for ,mruby,, a lightweight Ruby implementation.,
,As of at least 2015, the project seems to no longer be under active development.,

,FastCGI, is a ,binary protocol, for interfacing interactive programs with a ,web server,. FastCGI is a variation on the earlier ,Common Gateway Interface, (CGI); FastCGI's main aim is to reduce the overhead associated with interfacing the web server and ,CGI, programs, allowing a server to handle more web page requests at once.,

,History,[,edit,],
,CGI is a protocol for interfacing external applications to web servers. CGI applications run in separate ,processes,, which are created at the start of each request and torn down at the end. This ""one new process per request"" model makes CGI programs very simple to implement, but limits efficiency and scalability. At high loads, the operating system process creation and destruction overhead becomes significant. In addition, the CGI process model limits resource reuse techniques (such as reusing database connections, in-memory caching, etc.).,
,To address the scalability shortcomings of CGI, ,Open Market, developed FastCGI and first introduced it in their webserver product in the mid-1990s. Open Market originally developed FastCGI in part as a competitive response to ,Netscape's, proprietary, in-process API (,NSAPI,) for developing Web applications.,
,Although initially developed by ,Open Market,, FastCGI was implemented by a number of other webserver makers. The FastCGI approach, however, competed against other techniques which also aimed to speed and simplify server-subprogram communications. ,Apache, modules such as ,mod_perl, and ,mod_php, appeared around the same time, and they also quickly gained popularity. Today, all of these various approaches (including CGI) remain in common use.,
,Implementation details,[,edit,],
,Instead of creating a new process for each request, FastCGI uses persistent processes to handle a series of requests. These processes are owned by the FastCGI server, not the web server. ,[1],
,To service an incoming request, the web server sends ,environment information, and the page request itself to a FastCGI process over either a ,Unix domain socket,, a ,named pipe, or a ,TCP connection,. Responses are returned from the process to the web server over the same connection, and the web server subsequently delivers that response to the end-user. The connection may be closed at the end of a response, but both the web server and the FastCGI service processes persist.,[2],
,Each individual FastCGI process can handle many requests over its lifetime, thereby avoiding the overhead of per-request process creation and termination. Processing of multiple requests simultaneously can be achieved in several ways: by using a single connection with internal multiplexing (i.e. multiple requests over a single connection); by using multiple connections; or by a combination of these techniques. Multiple FastCGI servers can be configured, increasing stability and scalability.,
,Web site administrators and programmers can find that the separation of web applications from the web server in FastCGI has many advantages over embedded interpreters (,mod_perl,, ,mod_php,, etc.). This separation allows server and application processes to be restarted independently – an important consideration for busy web sites. It also enables the implementation of per-application / hosting service security policies, which is an important requirement for ISPs and web hosting companies.,[3], Different types of incoming requests can be distributed to specific FastCGI servers which have been equipped to handle those particular types of requests efficiently.,
,Web Servers that implement FastCGI,[,edit,],
,See also: ,Comparison of web server software § Features,
,
,Note: unless stated, completeness of FastCGI implementation is unknown,
,
,
,Apache HTTP Server, ,(partial),
,
,Implemented by ,mod_fcgid,. This module used to be third-party, but was granted to the ,ASF, as an Apache HTTP Server subproject in 2009, shepherded by Chris Darroch.,[4], It only supports ,UNIX sockets,, no TCP sockets.,[5],
,A third-party module ,mod_fastcgi, is also being used. For a while, this module no longer compiled properly under Apache 2.4.x,,[6], although that problem has been solved with a fork of the original project.,[7],
,Multiplexing of requests through a single connection is prohibited by Apache 1.x design,,[8], so this isn't supported,
,In Apache 2.4, ,mod_proxy_fcgi, was added, supporting TCP FastCGI servers.,

" 11 January 2018, at 15:30.","This article is about the software interface between a web server and programs. For other uses, see ,CGI (disambiguation),.,
,In ,computing,, ,Common Gateway Interface, (,CGI,) offers a standard ,protocol, for ,web servers, to execute programs that execute like ,Console applications, (also called ,Command-line interface programs,) running on a ,server, that ,generates web pages dynamically,. Such programs are known as ,CGI scripts, or simply as ,CGIs,. The specifics of how the script is executed by the server are determined by the server. In the common case, a CGI script executes at the time a request is made and generates HTML.,[1], In brief, the CGI program receives HTTP forms data via Unix/Linux standard input, and most other data (such as URL paths, URL arguments, and HTTP header data) via well-known Unix/Linux process environment variables.,

The official CGI logo from the spec announcement,
,
,
,In 1993 the ,National Center for Supercomputing Applications, (NCSA) team wrote the specification for calling command line executables on the www-talk mailing list.,[2],[3],[4], The other Web server developers adopted it, and it has been a standard for Web servers ever since. A work group chaired by ,Ken Coar, started in November 1997 to get the NCSA definition of CGI more formally defined.,[5], This work resulted in ,RFC 3875,, which specified CGI Version 1.1. Specifically mentioned in the RFC are the following contributors:,[6],
,
,Rob McCool, (author of the ,NCSA HTTPd, ,Web Server,),
,John Franks (author of the GN Web Server),
,Ari Luotonen, (the developer of the ,CERN httpd, Web Server),
,Tony Sanders (author of the Plexus Web Server),
,George Phillips (Web server maintainer at the ,University of British Columbia,),
,
,Historically CGI scripts were often written using the C language. ,RFC 3875, ""The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)"" partially defines CGI using C,,[7], as in saying that environment variables ""are accessed by the C library routine getenv() or variable environ"".,
,Purpose of the CGI standard,[,edit,],
,Each ,web server, runs ,HTTP, server software, which responds to requests from ,web browsers,. Generally, the HTTP server has a ,directory (folder),, which is designated as a document collection — files that can be sent to Web browsers connected to this server.,[8], For example, if the Web server has the domain name ,example.com,, and its document collection is stored at ,/usr/local/apache/htdocs, in the local file system, then the Web server will respond to a request for ,http://example.com/index.html, by sending to the browser the (pre-written) file ,/usr/local/apache/htdocs/index.html,.,
,For pages constructed on the fly, the server software may defer requests to separate programs and relay the results to the requesting client (usually, a web browser that displays the page to the end user). In the early days of the web, such programs were usually small and written in a scripting language; hence, they were known as ,scripts,.,
,Such programs usually require some additional information to be specified with the request. For instance, if Wikipedia were implemented as a script, one thing the script would need to know is whether the user is logged in and, if logged in, under which name. The content at the top of a Wikipedia page depends on this information.,
,HTTP provides ways for browsers to pass such information to the web server, e.g. as part of the URL. The server software must then pass this information through to the script somehow.,
,Conversely, upon returning, the script must provide all the information required by HTTP for a response to the request: the HTTP status of the request, the document content (if available), the document type (e.g. HTML, PDF, or plain text), etcetera.,
,Initially, different server software would use different ways to exchange this information with scripts. As a result, it wasn't possible to write scripts that would work unmodified for different server software, even though the information being exchanged was the same. Therefore, it was decided to establish a standard way for exchanging this information: CGI (the ,Common Gateway Interface,, as it defines a common way for server software to interface with scripts). Webpage generating programs invoked by server software that operate according to the CGI standard are known as ,CGI scripts,.,
,This standard was quickly adopted and is still supported by all well-known server software, such as ,Apache,, ,IIS,, and (with an extension) ,node.js,-based servers.,
,An early use of CGI scripts was to process forms. In the beginning of HTML, HTML forms typically had an ""action"" attribute and a button designated as the ""submit"" button. When the submit button is pushed the URI specified in the ""action"" attribute would be sent to the server with the data from the form sent as a query string. If the ""action"" specifies a CGI script then the CGI script would be executed and it then produces a HTML page.,
,Using CGI scripts,[,edit,],
,A web server allows its owner to configure which URLs shall be handled by which CGI scripts.,
,This is usually done by marking a directory within the document collection as containing CGI scripts — its name is often ,cgi-bin,. For example, ,/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin, could be designated as a CGI directory on the web server. When a Web browser requests a URL that points to a file within the CGI directory (e.g., ,http://example.com/cgi-bin/printenv.pl/with/additional/path?and=a&query=string,), then, instead of simply sending that file (,/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin/printenv.pl,) to the Web browser, the HTTP server runs the specified script and passes the output of the script to the Web browser. That is, anything that the script sends to ,standard output, is passed to the Web client instead of being shown on-screen in a terminal window.,
,As remarked above, the CGI standard defines how additional information passed with the request is passed to the script. For instance, if a slash and additional directory name(s) are appended to the URL immediately after the name of the script (in this example, ,/with/additional/path,), then that path is stored in the ,PATH_INFO, ,environment variable, before the script is called. If parameters are sent to the script via an ,HTTP GET, request (a question mark appended to the URL, followed by param=value pairs; in the example, ,?and=a&query=string,), then those parameters are stored in the ,QUERY_STRING, environment variable before the script is called. If parameters are sent to the script via an ,HTTP POST, request, they are passed to the script's ,standard input,. The script can then read these environment variables or data from standard input and adapt to the Web browser's request.,[9],
,Example,[,edit,],
,The following ,Perl, program shows all the environment variables passed by the Web server:,
,
,
,#!/usr/bin/perl,

,=head1 DESCRIPTION,

,printenv — a CGI program that just prints its environment,

,=cut,

,

,Some, but not all, of these variables are defined by the CGI standard. Some, such as ,PATH_INFO,, ,QUERY_STRING,, and the ones starting with ,HTTP_,, pass information along from the HTTP request.,
,From the environment, it can be seen that the Web browser is ,Firefox, running on a ,Windows 7, PC, the Web server is ,Apache, running on a system that emulates ,Unix,, and the CGI script is named ,cgi-bin/printenv.pl,.,
,The program could then generate any content, write that to ,standard output,, and the Web server will transmit it to the browser.,
,The following are ,environment variables, passed to CGI programs:,
,
,Server specific variables:,
,
,SERVER_SOFTWARE,: ,name,/,version, of ,HTTP server,.,
,SERVER_NAME,: ,host name, of the server, may be ,dot-decimal, IP address.,
,GATEWAY_INTERFACE,: CGI/,version,.,
,
,
,Request specific variables:,
,
,SERVER_PROTOCOL,: HTTP/,version,.,
,SERVER_PORT,: ,TCP port, (decimal).,
,REQUEST_METHOD,: name of HTTP method (see above).,
,PATH_INFO,: path suffix, if appended to URL after program name and a slash.,
,PATH_TRANSLATED,: corresponding ,full path, as supposed by server, if ,PATH_INFO, is present.,
,SCRIPT_NAME,: relative path to the program, like ,/cgi-bin/script.cgi,.,
,QUERY_STRING,: the part of URL after ,?, character. The ,query string, may be composed of *,name,=,value, pairs separated with ,ampersands, (such as ,var1,=,val1,&,var2,=,val2,...) when used to submit ,form, data transferred via GET method as defined by HTML ,application/x-www-form-urlencoded,.,
,REMOTE_HOST,: host name of the client, unset if server did not perform such lookup.,
,REMOTE_ADDR,: ,IP address, of the client (dot-decimal).,
,AUTH_TYPE,: identification type, if applicable.,
,REMOTE_USER, used for certain ,AUTH_TYPE,s.,
,REMOTE_IDENT,: see ,ident,, only if server performed such lookup.,
,CONTENT_TYPE,: ,Internet media type, of input data if PUT or POST method are used, as provided via HTTP header.,
,CONTENT_LENGTH,: similarly, size of input data (decimal, in ,octets,) if provided via HTTP header.,
,Variables passed by user agent (,HTTP_ACCEPT,, ,HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE,, ,HTTP_USER_AGENT,, ,HTTP_COOKIE, and possibly others) contain values of corresponding ,HTTP headers, and therefore have the same sense.,
,
,
,
,The program returns the result to the Web server in the form of standard output, beginning with a header and a ,blank line,.,
,The header is encoded in the same way as an ,HTTP header, and must include the ,MIME type, of the document returned.,[10], The headers, supplemented by the Web server, are generally forwarded with the response back to the user.,
,Here is a simple CGI program written in Python 2 along with the HTML that handles a simple addition problem.,[11],
,
,
,<!DOCTYPE html>,
,<,html,>,
 ,<,body,>,
  ,<,form, ,action,=,""add.cgi"", ,method,=,""POST"",>,
   Enter two numbers to add:,<,br, ,/>,
   First Number: ,<,input, ,type,=,""text"", ,name,=,""num1"", ,/><,br, ,/>,
   Second Number: ,<,input, ,type,=,""text"", ,name,=,""num2"", ,/><,br, ,/>,
   ,<,input, ,type,=,""submit"", ,value,=,""Add"", ,/>,
  ,</,form,>,
 ,</,body,>,
,</,html,>,
,
,
,
,#!/usr/bin/env python2,

,import, ,cgi,
,import, ,cgitb,
,cgitb,.,enable,(),

,input_data, ,=, ,cgi,.,FieldStorage,(),

,print, ,'Content-Type:text/html', ,# HTML is following,
,print,                          ,# Leave a blank line,
,print, ,'<h1>Addition Results</h1>',
,try,:,
  ,num1, ,=, ,int,(,input_data,[,""num1"",],.,value,),
  ,num2, ,=, ,int,(,input_data,[,""num2"",],.,value,),
,except,:,
  ,print, ,'<p>Sorry, we cannot turn your inputs into numbers (integers).</p>',
  ,return, ,1,
,print, ,'<p>{0} + {1} = {2}</p>',.,format,(,num1,,, ,num2,,, ,num1, ,+, ,num2,),
,
,This Python 2 CGI gets the inputs from the HTML and adds the two numbers together.,
,Deployment,[,edit,],
,A Web server that supports CGI can be configured to interpret a ,URL, that it serves as a reference to a CGI script. A common convention is to have a ,cgi-bin/, ,directory, at the base of the directory tree and treat all executable files within this directory (and no other, for security) as CGI scripts. Another popular convention is to use ,filename extensions,; for instance, if CGI scripts are consistently given the extension ,.cgi,, the web server can be configured to interpret all such files as CGI scripts. While convenient, and required by many prepackaged scripts, it opens the server to attack if a remote user can upload executable code with the proper extension.,[,citation needed,],
,In the case of ,HTTP PUT or POSTs,, the user-submitted data are provided to the program via the ,standard input,. The Web server creates a subset of the ,environment variables, passed to it and adds details pertinent to the HTTP environment.,
,Uses,[,edit,],
,CGI is often used to process inputs information from the user and produce the appropriate output. An example of a CGI program is one implementing a ,Wiki,. The user agent requests the name of an entry; the Web server executes the CGI; the CGI program retrieves the source of that entry's page (if one exists), transforms it into ,HTML,, and prints the result. The web server receives the input from the CGI and transmits it to the user agent. If the ""Edit this page"" link is clicked, the CGI populates an HTML ,textarea, or other editing control with the page's contents, and saves it back to the server when the user submits the form in it.,
,Alternatives,[,edit,],
,Calling a command generally means the invocation of a newly created ,process, on the server. Starting the process can consume much more time and memory than the actual work of generating the output, especially when the program still needs to be ,interpreted, or ,compiled,. If the command is called often, the resulting workload can quickly overwhelm the server.,
,The ,overhead, involved in process creation can be reduced by techniques such as ,FastCGI, that ""prefork"" interpreter processes, or by running the application code entirely within the web server, using extension modules such as ,mod_perl, or ,mod_php,. Another way to reduce the overhead is to use precompiled CGI programs, e.g. by writing them in languages such as ,C, or ,C++,, rather than interpreted or compiled-on-the-fly languages such as ,Perl, or ,PHP,, or by implementing the page generating software as a custom webserver module.,
,Alternative approaches include:,
,
,Extensions such as ,Apache modules,, ,NSAPI, plugins, and ,ISAPI, plugins allow third-party software to run on the web server.,
,FastCGI, reduces overhead by allowing a single, long-running process to handle more than one user request. Unlike converting an application to a web server plug-in, FastCGI applications remain independent of the web server.,
,Simple Common Gateway Interface, or SCGI is designed to be easier to implement, yet it reduces latency in some operations compared to CGI.,
,Replacement of the architecture for dynamic websites can also be used. This is the approach taken by ,Java EE,, which runs Java code in a Java servlet container in order to serve dynamic content and optionally static content. This approach replaces the overhead of generating and destroying processes with the much lower overhead of generating and destroying ,threads,, and also exposes the programmer to the library that comes with ,Java Platform, Standard Edition, on which the version of Java EE in use is based.,
,
,The optimal configuration for any Web application depends on application-specific details, amount of traffic, and complexity of the transaction; these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget.,

,Phusion Passenger, (informally also known as ,mod_rails, and ,mod_rack, among the Ruby community) is a ,free, web server and application server with support for ,Ruby,, ,Python, and ,Node.js,. It is designed to integrate into the ,Apache HTTP Server, or the ,nginx, web server, but also has a mode for running standalone without an external web server.,[3], Phusion Passenger supports ,Unix-like, operating systems, and is available as a ,gem package,, as a tarball, or as native Linux packages.,
,Originally designed for web applications built on the ,Ruby on Rails, framework, it was later extended to support arbitrary Ruby web frameworks through ,the Rack interface,. Later versions also added support for Python through ,the WSGI interface,, as well as support for Node.js.,[4], In 2012, Phusion announced ,Phusion Passenger Enterprise,, a paid, commercial variant of Phusion Passenger with ""a wide array of premium features"".,[5], Phusion has stated that the open source variant will continue to be developed and maintained along with the Enterprise variant.,
,Phusion Passenger is the ""preferred deployment setup"" for Ruby on Rails applications,,[6], and has been recommended by the Ruby on Rails authors.,[7],[8], In combination with Ruby 2.0, or with the now-discontinued ,Ruby Enterprise Edition,, Phusion Passenger claims that it is capable of reducing Rails's memory consumption by 33% as well as increasing its performance.,[9],

Впервые термин использовался по отношению к ,Гвидо ван Россуму,, создателю языка ,Python,[1],[2],.,
,В своем эссе «,Заселяя ноосферу,[en],» ,Эрик Рэймонд,, в частности, обсуждает феномен «великодушной диктатуры» в сообществе свободного ПО. Согласно Рэймонду, «диктатор» свободного проекта обязан быть ,великодушным,, поскольку, если набирается достаточно разработчиков, не согласных с решениями «диктатора», они в любой момент могут уйти из проекта или создать ,форк,.,

,Nginx, ( ,/,ˌ,ɛ,n,dʒ,ɪ,n,ˈ,ɛ,k,s,/, ,EN,-jin-,EKS,) (stylized as ,NGINX,, ,NGiИX, or ,nginx,) is a ,web server, which can also be used as a ,reverse proxy,, ,load balancer, and ,HTTP cache,. The software was created by ,Igor Sysoev, and first publicly released in 2004.,[8], A company of the same name was founded in 2011 to provide support.,[9],
,Nginx is ,free and open source software,, released under the terms of a ,BSD,-like license. A large fraction of web servers use NGINX,,[10], often as a ,load balancer,.,[11],

,Features,[,edit,],
,Nginx can be deployed to serve dynamic ,HTTP, content on the network using ,FastCGI,, ,SCGI, handlers for ,scripts,, ,WSGI, application servers or ,Phusion Passenger, modules, and it can serve as a software ,load balancer,.,[12],
,Nginx uses an ,asynchronous, ,event-driven, approach to handling requests. Nginx's modular event-driven architecture,[13], can provide more predictable performance under high loads.,[14],
,According to ,Netcraft,'s November 2016 Web Server Survey,,[15], Nginx was found to be the second most widely used web server across all ""active"" sites (18.22% of surveyed sites) and for the top million busiest sites (27.83% of surveyed sites). According to W3Techs, it was used by 37.7% of the top 1 million websites, 49.7% of the top 100,000 websites, and by 57.0% of the top 10,000 websites.,[16], According to BuiltWith, it is used on 38.2% of the top 10,000 websites, and its growth within the top 10k, 100k and 1 million segments increased.,[17], Wikipedia uses Nginx as its ,SSL termination proxy,.,[18], As of ,OpenBSD, release 5.2 (1 November 2012), Nginx became part of the OpenBSD base system, providing an alternative to the system's fork of Apache 1.3, which it was intended to replace,,[19], but it was later replaced by OpenBSD's own httpd(8).,[20],
,HTTP proxy and Web server features,[,edit,],
,
,Ability to handle ,more than 10,000 simultaneous connections, with a low memory footprint (~2.5 MB per 10k inactive ,HTTP keep-alive connections,),
,Handling of static files, index files and auto-indexing,
,Reverse proxy, with caching,
,Load balancing, with in-band health checks,[21],
,TLS/SSL, with ,SNI, and ,OCSP stapling, support, via ,OpenSSL,.,
,FastCGI,, ,SCGI,, ,uWSGI, support with caching,
,Name- and IP address-based virtual servers,
,IPv6,-compatible,
,WebSockets, and ,HTTP/1.1 Upgrade (101 Switching Protocols),[22],
,
,Mail proxy features,[,edit,],
,
,TLS/SSL, support,
,STARTTLS, support,
,SMTP,, ,POP3,, and ,IMAP, ,proxy,
,Authentication using an external HTTP server,[23],
,
,Other features include upgrading executable and configuration without client connections loss,,[24], and a module-based architecture with both core,[25], and third-party module support.,[26],
,The paid Plus product includes additional features such as advanced load balancing and access to an expanded suite of metrics for performance monitoring.,[27],[28],
,Performance vs Apache,[,edit,],
,Nginx was written with an explicit goal of outperforming the ,Apache, web server.,[29], Out of the box, serving static files, Nginx uses dramatically less memory than Apache, and can handle roughly four times more requests per second.,[30], This performance boost comes at a cost of decreased flexibility, such as the ability to override systemwide access settings on a per-file basis (Apache accomplishes this with an ,.htaccess, file, while Nginx has no such feature built in).,[31], Formerly, adding third party modules to nginx required ,recompiling, the application from source with the modules ,statically linked,. This was partially overcome in version 1.9.11 with the addition of ,dynamic module loading,. However, the modules still must be compiled at the same time as nginx, and not all modules are compatible with this system—some require the older static linking process.,[32],

,Igor Sysoev began development of Nginx in 2002.,[8], Originally, Nginx was developed to solve the ,C10K Problem,, and to fill the needs of ,websites, including ,Rambler,, for which it was serving 500 million requests per day by September 2008.,[33],[34],
,A company of the same name was founded in July 2011 by Sysoev to provide commercial products and support for the software.,[35],
,The company's principal place of business is ,San Francisco,, ,California,, while legally incorporated in ,British Virgin Islands,.,[9],
,In October 2011, Nginx raised $3 million from ,BV Capital,, ,Runa Capital, and ,MSD Capital,, ,Michael Dell,‘s venture fund.,[36],
,The company announced commercial support options for companies using Nginx in production. Nginx offered commercial support in February 2012,,[37],[38], and paid Nginx Plus subscription in August 2013.,[39],
,Support packages focus on installation, configuration, performance improvement, etc.,[40], Support includes proactive notifications about major changes, security patches, updates and patches.,
,WordPress, developer ,Automattic, and content delivery network provider ,MaxCDN, became funding partners for an update to ,Google,'s ,SPDY, version 3.1, slated for early 2014.,[41],
,Nginx also offers consulting services to assist customers in custom configuration or adding additional features.,[42],
,In October 2013, Nginx raised a $10 million series B investment round led by ,New Enterprise Associates,.,[43], That round included previous investors, as well as ,Aaron Levie,, CEO and founder of ,Box.com,.,[44],[45], In December 2014, Nginx raised a $20 million series B1 round led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation from e.ventures (formerly ,BV Capital,), Runa Capital, ,Index Ventures, and Nginx’s own CEO Gus Robertson.,[46],[47],

Anything between the ,kernel, and user applications is considered middleware.,
,
,
,Middleware, is computer ,software, that provides services to ,software applications, beyond those available from the ,operating system,. It can be described as ""software glue"".,[1],
,Middleware makes it easier for ,software developers, to implement communication and ,input/output,, so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application.,

Software architecture: Middleware,
,
,
,The term is most commonly used for software that enables communication and management of data in ,distributed applications,. An ,IETF, workshop in 2000 defined middleware as ""those services found above the ,transport, (i.e. over TCP/IP) layer set of services but below the application environment"" (i.e. below application-level ,APIs,).,[2], In this more specific sense ,middleware, can be described as the dash (""-"") in ,client-server,, or the ,-to-, in ,peer-to-peer,.,[,citation needed,], Middleware includes ,web servers,, ,application servers,, ,content management systems,, and similar tools that support application development and delivery.,
,ObjectWeb defines middleware as: ""The software layer that lies between the ,operating system, and applications on each side of a distributed computing system in a network."",[3], Services that can be regarded as middleware include ,enterprise application integration,, ,data integration,, ,message oriented middleware, (MOM), ,object request brokers, (ORBs), and the ,enterprise service bus, (ESB).,
,Database, access services are often characterised as middleware. Some of them are language specific implementations and support heterogeneous features and other related communication features. Examples of database-oriented middleware include ,ODBC,, ,JDBC, and ,transaction processing, monitors.,
,Distributed computing system middleware can loosely be divided into two categories—those that provide human-time services (such as web request servicing) and those that perform in machine-time. This latter middleware is somewhat standardized through the ,Service Availability Forum, and is commonly used in complex, ,embedded systems, within telecom, defense and ,aerospace, industries.,
,Other examples,[,edit,],
,The term ,middleware, is used in other contexts as well. ,Middleware, is sometimes used in a similar sense to a ,software driver,, an abstraction layer that hides detail about hardware devices or other software from an application.,
,
,The ,mer, software distribution is a middleware: it lacks the ,Linux kernel, and it also lacks a UI. Mer is targeted at hardware vendors' mobile-oriented operating systems.,
,The ,Android, operating system uses the ,Linux, kernel at its core, and also provides an ,application framework, that developers incorporate into their applications. In addition, ,Android, provides a middleware layer including ,libraries, that provide services such as data storage, screen display, ,multimedia,, and web browsing. Because the middleware libraries are ,compiled, to ,machine language,, services execute quickly. Middleware libraries also implement device-specific functions, so applications and the application framework need not concern themselves with variations between various Android devices. Android's middleware layer also contains the ,Dalvik, ,virtual machine, and its core ,Java, application libraries.,[4],
,Game engine, software such as ,Gamebryo, and ,Renderware, are sometimes described as middleware, because they provide many services to simplify game development.,
,In simulation technology, ,middleware, is generally used in the context of the ,high level architecture, (HLA) that applies to many distributed simulations. It is a layer of software that lies between the ,application code, and the ,run-time infrastructure,. Middleware generally consists of a library of functions, and enables a number of applications—simulations or federates in HLA terminology—to ,page, these functions from the common library rather than re-create them for each application.,
,Wireless networking developers can use middleware to meet the challenges associated with a ,wireless sensor network, (WSN). Implementing a middleware application allows WSN ,developers, to integrate operating systems and hardware with the wide variety of various applications that are currently available.,[5],
,The ,QNX, operating system offers middleware for providing multimedia services for use in ,automobiles,, ,aircraft, and other environments.,
,Multimedia Home Platform, (DVB-MHP) is an open middleware system standard designed by the ,Digital Video Broadcasting, (DVB) project for interactive digital television. The MHP enables the reception and execution of interactive, Java-based applications on a television set.,
,Universal Home API,, or UHAPI, is an application programming interface (API) for consumer electronics appliances, created by the UHAPI Forum. The objective of UHAPI is to enable standard middleware to run on audio/video streaming platforms via a hardware-independent industry standard API.,
,The ,Miles Sound System, provided a middleware ,software driver, allowing developers to build software that worked with a range of different sound cards, without concerning themselves with the details of each card.,
,Radio-frequency identification, software toolkits provide middleware to filter noisy and redundant raw data.,
,Television,, ,media, and ,set-top-box, software often refers to middleware. For instance, ,OpenTV 5, middleware (sometimes called Connectware) is a ,Linux, and ,HTML5, distribution for set-top-box including a default TV navigation guide and provides open APIs to tailored TV user experience that can leverage the home cloud, broadcast video and web services for Pay-TV operators.,
,
,Boundaries,[,edit,],
,The distinction between operating system and middleware functionality is, to some extent, arbitrary. While core kernel functionality can only be provided by the operating system itself, some functionality previously provided by separately sold middleware is now integrated in operating systems. A typical example is the ,TCP/IP stack, for telecommunications, nowadays included in virtually every operating system. At the other end of the scale, the boundary between middleware and application has also moved. ,Digital TV middleware, for example usually provides enough functionality so that no ""application"" is needed for end-users to be able to use the TV services.,
,Origins,[,edit,],
,Middleware gained popularity in the 1980s as a solution to the problem of how to link newer applications to older legacy systems, although the term had been in use since 1968.,[6], It also facilitated ,distributed processing,, the connection of multiple applications to create a larger application, usually over a network.,

Overview of a Java virtual machine (JVM) architecture based on The Java Virtual Machine Specification Java SE 7 Edition,
,
,
,A ,Java virtual machine, (,JVM,) is ,an abstract computing machine, that enables a computer to run a ,Java, program. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance. The specification is a document that formally describes what is required of a JVM implementation. Having a single specification ensures all implementations are ,interoperable,. A JVM implementation is a computer program that meets the requirements of the JVM specification. An instance of a JVM is an implementation running in a ,process, that executes a computer program compiled into ,Java bytecode,.,
,Java Runtime Environment, (,JRE,) is a software package that contains what is required to run a Java program. It includes a Java Virtual Machine implementation together with an implementation of the ,Java Class Library,. The ,Oracle Corporation,, which owns the Java trademark, distributes a Java Runtime environment with their Java Virtual Machine called ,HotSpot,.,
,Java Development Kit, (,JDK,) is a superset of a JRE and contains tools for Java programmers, e.g. a ,javac, compiler. The Java Development Kit is provided free of charge either by Oracle Corporation directly, or by the ,OpenJDK, open source project, which is governed by Oracle.,

,JVM specification,[,edit,],
,The Java virtual machine is an abstract (virtual) computer defined by a specification. This specification omits implementation details that are not essential to ensure interoperability: the memory layout of run-time data areas, the garbage-collection algorithm used, and any internal optimization of the Java virtual machine instructions (their translation into machine code). The main reason for this omission is to not unnecessarily constrain implementers. Any Java application can be run only inside some concrete implementation of the abstract specification of the Java virtual machine.,[1],
,Starting with ,Java Platform, Standard Edition, (J2SE) 5.0, changes to the JVM specification have been developed under the ,Java Community Process, as JSR 924.,[2], As of 2006,[update],, changes to specification to support changes proposed to the ,class file format, (JSR 202),[3], are being done as a maintenance release of JSR 924. The specification for the JVM was published as the ,blue book,,,[4], The preface states:,
,
,We intend that this specification should sufficiently document the Java Virtual Machine to make possible compatible clean-room implementations. Oracle provides tests that verify the proper operation of implementations of the Java Virtual Machine.,
,
,One of Oracle's JVMs is named ,HotSpot,, the other, inherited from ,BEA Systems, is ,JRockit,. ,Clean-room, Java implementations include ,Kaffe, and ,IBM J9,. Oracle owns the Java trademark and may allow its use to certify implementation suites as fully compatible with Oracle's specification.,
,Class loader,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Java Class loader,
,One of the organizational units of JVM byte code is a class. A class loader implementation must be able to recognize and load anything that conforms to the Java class file format. Any implementation is free to recognize other binary forms besides ,class, files, but it must recognize ,class, files.,
,The class loader performs three basic activities in this strict order:,
,
,Loading: finds and imports the binary data for a type,
,Linking: performs verification, preparation, and (optionally) resolution
,
,Verification: ensures the correctness of the imported type,
,Preparation: allocates memory for class variables and initializing the memory to default values,
,Resolution: transforms symbolic references from the type into direct references.,
,
,
,Initialization: invokes Java code that initializes class variables to their proper starting values.,
,
,In general, there are two types of class loader: bootstrap class loader and user defined class loader.,
,Every Java virtual machine implementation must have a bootstrap class loader, capable of loading trusted classes. The Java virtual machine specification doesn't specify how a class loader should locate classes.,
,Virtual machine architecture,[,edit,],
,The JVM operates on primitive values (integers and floating-point numbers) and ,references,. The JVM is fundamentally a 32-bit machine. ,long, and ,double, types, which are 64-bits, are supported natively, but consume two units of storage in a frame's local variables or operand stack, since each unit is 32 bits. ,boolean,, ,byte,, ,short,, and ,char, types are all sign-extended (except ,char, which is zero-extended) and operated on as 32-bit integers, the same as ,int, types. The smaller types only have a few type-specific instructions for loading, storing, and type conversion. ,boolean, is not known at all to the JVM; booleans are operated on as 8-bit ,byte, values, with 0 representing ,false, and 1 representing ,true,.,
,The JVM has a garbage-collected heap for storing objects and arrays. Code, constants, and other class data are stored in the ""method area"". The method area is logically part of the heap, but implementations may treat the method area separately from the heap, and for example might not garbage collect it. Each JVM thread also has its own ,call stack, (called a ""Java Virtual Machine stack"" for clarity), which stores ,frames,. A new frame is created each time a method is called, and the frame is destroyed when that method exits.,
,Each frame provides an ""operand stack"" and an array of ""local variables"". The operand stack is used for operands to computations and for receiving the return value of a called method, while local variables serve the same purpose as ,registers, and are also used to pass method arguments. Thus, the JVM is both a ,stack machine, and a ,register machine,.,
,Bytecode instructions,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Java bytecode,
,The JVM has ,instructions, for the following groups of tasks:,
,
,
,Load and store,
,Arithmetic,
,Type conversion,
,Object creation and manipulation,
,Operand stack management (push / pop),
,Control transfer (branching),
,Method invocation and return,
,Throwing exceptions,
,Monitor-based concurrency,
,
,
,The aim is binary compatibility. Each particular host ,operating system, needs its own implementation of the JVM and runtime. These JVMs interpret the bytecode semantically the same way, but the actual implementation may be different. More complex than just emulating bytecode is compatibly and efficiently implementing the ,Java core API, that must be mapped to each host operating system.,
,These instructions operate on a set of common ,abstracted ,data types, rather the ,native data types, of any specific ,instruction set architecture,.,
,JVM languages,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,List of JVM languages,
,A JVM language is any language with functionality that can be expressed in terms of a valid class file which can be hosted by the Java Virtual Machine. A class file contains Java Virtual Machine instructions (,Java byte code,) and a symbol table, as well as other ancillary information. The class file format is the hardware- and operating system-independent binary format used to represent compiled classes and interfaces.,[5],
,There are several JVM languages, both old languages ported to JVM and completely new languages. ,JRuby, and ,Jython, are perhaps the most well-known ports of existing languages, i.e. ,Ruby, and ,Python, respectively. Of the new languages that have been created from scratch to compile to Java bytecode, ,Clojure,, ,Apache Groovy,, ,Scala, and ,Kotlin, may be the most popular ones. A notable feature with the JVM languages is that they are ,compatible with each other,, so that, for example, Scala libraries can be used with Java programs and vice versa.,[6],
,Java 7 JVM implements ,JSR 292: Supporting Dynamically Typed Languages,[7], on the Java Platform, a new feature which supports dynamically typed languages in the JVM. This feature is developed within the ,Da Vinci Machine, project whose mission is to extend the JVM so that it supports languages other than Java.,[8],[9],
,Bytecode verifier,[,edit,],
,A basic philosophy of Java is that it is inherently safe from the standpoint that no user program can crash the host machine or otherwise interfere inappropriately with other operations on the host machine, and that it is possible to protect certain methods and data structures belonging to trusted code from access or corruption by untrusted code executing within the same JVM. Furthermore, common programmer errors that often led to data corruption or unpredictable behavior such as accessing off the end of an array or using an uninitialized pointer are not allowed to occur. Several features of Java combine to provide this safety, including the class model, the garbage-collected ,heap,, and the verifier.,
,The JVM verifies all bytecode before it is executed. This verification consists primarily of three types of checks:,
,
,Branches are always to valid locations,
,Data is always initialized and references are always type-safe,
,Access to private or package private data and methods is rigidly controlled,
,
,The first two of these checks take place primarily during the verification step that occurs when a class is loaded and made eligible for use. The third is primarily performed dynamically, when data items or methods of a class are first accessed by another class.,
,The verifier permits only some bytecode sequences in valid programs, e.g. a ,jump (branch) instruction, can only target an instruction within the same ,method,. Furthermore, the verifier ensures that any given instruction operates on a fixed stack location,,[10], allowing the JIT compiler to transform stack accesses into fixed register accesses. Because of this, that the JVM is a stack architecture does not imply a speed penalty for emulation on ,register-based architectures, when using a JIT compiler. In the face of the code-verified JVM architecture, it makes no difference to a JIT compiler whether it gets named imaginary registers or imaginary stack positions that must be allocated to the target architecture's registers. In fact, code verification makes the JVM different from a classic stack architecture, of which efficient emulation with a JIT compiler is more complicated and typically carried out by a slower interpreter.,
,The original specification for the bytecode verifier used natural language that was incomplete or incorrect in some respects. A number of attempts have been made to specify the JVM as a formal system. By doing this, the security of current JVM implementations can more thoroughly be analyzed, and potential security exploits prevented. It will also be possible to optimize the JVM by skipping unnecessary safety checks, if the application being run is proven to be safe.,[11],
,Secure execution of remote code,[,edit,],
,A virtual machine architecture allows very fine-grained control over the actions that code within the machine is permitted to take. It assumes the code is ""semantically"" correct, that is, it successfully passed the (formal) bytecode verifier process, materialized by a tool, possibly off-board the virtual machine. This is designed to allow safe execution of untrusted code from remote sources, a model used by ,Java applets,, and other secure code downloads. Once bytecode-verified, the downloaded code runs in a restricted "",sandbox,"", which is designed to protect the user from misbehaving or malicious code. As an addition to the bytecode verification process, publishers can purchase a certificate with which to ,digitally sign, applets as safe, giving them permission to ask the user to break out of the sandbox and access the local file system, ,clipboard,, execute external pieces of software, or network.,
,Formal proof of bytecode verifiers have been done by the Javacard industry (Formal Development of an Embedded Verifier for Java Card Byte Code,[12],),
,Bytecode interpreter and just-in-time compiler,[,edit,],
,For each ,hardware architecture, a different Java bytecode ,interpreter, is needed. When a computer has a Java bytecode interpreter, it can run any Java bytecode program, and the same program can be run on any computer that has such an interpreter.,
,When Java bytecode is executed by an interpreter, the execution will always be slower than the execution of the same program compiled into native machine language. This problem is mitigated by ,just-in-time (JIT) compilers, for executing Java bytecode. A JIT compiler may translate Java bytecode into native machine language while executing the program. The translated parts of the program can then be executed much more quickly than they could be interpreted. This technique gets applied to those parts of a program frequently executed. This way a JIT compiler can significantly speed up the overall execution time.,
,There is no necessary connection between the Java programming language and Java bytecode. A program written in Java can be compiled directly into the machine language of a real computer and programs written in other languages than Java can be compiled into Java bytecode.,
,Java bytecode is intended to be platform-independent and secure.,[13], Some JVM implementations do not include an interpreter, but consist only of a just-in-time compiler.,[14],
,JVM in the web browser,[,edit,],
,Since the very early stages of the design process, Java (and JVM) has been marketed as a web technology for creating ,Rich Internet Applications,.,
,Java applets,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Java applet,
,On the client side, web browsers may be extended with a ,NPAPI, Java plugin which executes so called ,Java applets, embedded into HTML pages. The applet is allowed to draw into a rectangular region on the page assigned to it and use a restricted set of APIs that allow for example access to user's microphone or 3D acceleration. Java applets were superior to ,JavaScript, both in performance and features until approximately 2011, when JavaScript engines in browsers were made significantly faster and the ,HTML 5, suite of web technologies started enhancing JavaScript with new APIs. Java applets are not able to modify the page outside its rectangular region which is not true about JavaScript. ,Adobe Flash Player,, the main competing technology, works in the same way in this respect. Java applets are not restricted to Java and in general can be created in any JVM language.,
,As of April 2014, ,Google Chrome, does not allow the use of any NPAPI plugins.,[15], ,Mozilla Firefox, will also ban NPAPI plugins by the end of 2016. This means that Java applets can no longer be used in either browser.,[16], Oracle ultimately announced in January 2016 that it will discontinue the Java web browser plugin effective Java 9.,[17],
,As of June 2015,[update], according to W3Techs, Java applet use had fallen to 0.1% of all web sites. Flash had fallen to 10.8% and Silverlight to 0.1% of web sites.,[18],
,JavaScript JVMs and interpreters,[,edit,],
,As of May 2016, ,JavaPoly, allows users to import unmodified Java libraries, and invoke them directly from JavaScript. JavaPoly allows websites to use run unmodified Java libraries, even if the user does not have Java installed on their computer.,[19],
,Compilation to JavaScript,[,edit,],
,With the continuing improvements in JavaScript execution speed, combined with the increased use of mobile devices whose web browsers do not implement support for plugins, there are efforts to target those users through compilation to JavaScript. It is possible to either compile the source code or JVM bytecode to JavaScript.,
,Compiling the JVM bytecode, which is universal across JVM languages, allows building upon the language's existing compiler to bytecode. The main JVM bytecode to JavaScript compilers are TeaVM,,[20], the compiler contained in Dragome Web SDK,,[21], Bck2Brwsr,,[22], and j2js-compiler.,[23],
,Leading compilers from JVM languages to JavaScript include the Java-to-JavaScript compiler contained in ,Google Web Toolkit,, Clojurescript (,Clojure,), GrooScript (,Apache Groovy,), ,Scala.js, (Scala) and others.,[24],
,Java Runtime Environment,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,HotSpot,
,The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) released by Oracle is a software distribution containing a stand-alone Java VM (,HotSpot,), a browser plugin (discontinued since ,Java 9,), the Java ,standard library, (,Java Class Library,) and a configuration tool. It is the most common Java environment installed on Windows computers. It is freely available for download at the website java.com.,
,Performance,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Java performance,
,The JVM specification gives a lot of leeway to implementors regarding the implementation details. Since Java 1.3, JRE from Oracle contains a JVM called HotSpot. It has been designed to be a high-performance JVM.,
,To speed-up code execution, HotSpot relies on just-in-time compilation. To speed-up object allocation and garbage collection, HotSpot uses generational heap.,
,Generational heap,[,edit,],
,The ,Java virtual machine heap, is the area of memory used by the JVM for ,dynamic memory allocation,.,[25],
,In HotSpot the heap is divided into ,generations,:,
,
,The ,young generation, stores short-lived ,objects, that are created and immediately ,garbage collected,.,
,Objects that persist longer are moved to the ,old generation, (also called the ,tenured generation,). This memory is subdivided into (two) Survivors spaces where the objects that survived the first and next garbage collections are stored.,
,
,The ,permanent generation, (or ,permgen,) was used for ,class, definitions and associated metadata prior to Java 8. Permanent generation was not part of the heap.,[26],[27], The ,permanent generation, was removed from Java 8.,[28],
,Originally there was no permanent generation, and objects and classes were stored together in the same area. But as class unloading occurs much more rarely than objects are collected, moving class structures to a specific area allowed significant performance improvements.,[26],
,Security,[,edit,],
,Oracle's JRE is installed on a large number of computers. Since any web page the user visits may run Java applets, Java provides an easily accessible ,attack surface, to malicious web sites that the user visits. Kaspersky Labs reports that the Java web browser plugin is the method of choice for computer criminals. Java exploits are included in many exploit packs that hackers deploy onto hacked web sites.,[29],
,In the past, end users were often using an out-of-date version of JRE which was vulnerable to many known attacks. This led to the widely shared belief between users that Java is inherently insecure.,[30], Since Java 1.7, Oracle's JRE for Windows includes automatic update functionality.,

" 17 January 2018, at 17:44.","Not to be confused with ,Content management, or ,Information management,.,
,Knowledge management, (,KM,) is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the ,knowledge, and information of an organisation.,[1], It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieving organisational objectives by making the best use of knowledge.,[2],
,An established ,discipline, since 1991, KM includes courses taught in the fields of ,business administration,, ,information systems,, management, library, and ,information sciences,.,[3],[4], Other fields may contribute to KM research, including information and media, ,computer science,, ,public health, and ,public policy,.,[5], Several universities offer dedicated ,master's degrees, in knowledge management.,
,Many large companies, public institutions and non-profit organisations have resources dedicated to internal KM efforts, often as a part of their ,business strategy,, ,IT,, or ,human resource management, departments.,[6], Several consulting companies provide advice regarding KM to these organisations.,[6],
,Knowledge management efforts typically focus on organisational objectives such as improved performance, ,competitive advantage,, ,innovation,, the sharing of lessons learned, integration and ,continuous improvement, of the organisation.,[7], These efforts overlap with ,organisational learning, and may be distinguished from that by a greater focus on the management of knowledge as a strategic asset and on encouraging the ,sharing of knowledge,.,[2],[8], KM is an enabler of organisational learning.,[9],[10],

,History,[,edit,],
,Knowledge management efforts have a long history, including on-the-job discussions, formal ,apprenticeship,, ,discussion forums,, corporate libraries, professional training, and mentoring programs.,[2],[10], With increased use of computers in the second half of the 20th century, specific ,adaptations, of technologies such as ,knowledge bases,, ,expert systems,, ,information repositories,, group ,decision support systems,, ,intranets,, and ,computer-supported cooperative work, have been introduced to further enhance such efforts.,[2],
,In 1999, the term ,personal knowledge management, was introduced; it refers to the management of knowledge at the individual level.,[11],
,In the enterprise, early collections of case studies recognised the importance of knowledge management dimensions of strategy, ,process, and ,measurement,.,[12],[13], Key lessons learned include people and the cultural norms which influence their behaviors are the most critical resources for successful knowledge creation, dissemination and application; cognitive, social and organisational learning processes are essential to the success of a knowledge management strategy; and measurement, ,benchmarking, and incentives are essential to accelerate the learning process and to drive cultural change.,[13], In short, knowledge management programs can yield impressive benefits to individuals and organisations if they are purposeful, concrete and action-orientated.,
,Research,[,edit,],
,KM emerged as a scientific discipline in the early 1990s.,[14], It was initially supported by individual practitioners, when ,Skandia, hired Leif Edvinsson of Sweden as the world's first ,Chief Knowledge Officer, (CKO).,[15], Hubert Saint-Onge (formerly of ,CIBC,, Canada), started investigating KM long before that.,[2], The objective of CKOs is to manage and maximise the intangible assets of their organisations.,[2], Gradually, CKOs became interested in practical and theoretical aspects of KM, and the new research field was formed.,[16], The KM idea has been taken up by academics, such as ,Ikujiro Nonaka, (,Hitotsubashi University,), Hirotaka Takeuchi (Hitotsubashi University), ,Thomas H. Davenport, (,Babson College,) and Baruch Lev (,New York University,).,[3],[17], In 2001, ,Thomas A. Stewart,, former editor at ,Fortune, magazine and subsequently the editor of ,Harvard Business Review,, published a cover story highlighting the importance of intellectual capital in organisations.,[18], The KM discipline has been gradually moving towards academic maturity.,[2], First, is a trend toward higher cooperation among academics; single-author publications are less common. Second, the role of practitioners has changed.,[16], Their contribution to academic research declined from 30% of overall contributions up to 2002, to only 10% by 2009.,[19], Third, the number of academic knowledge management journals has been steadily growing, currently reaching 27 outlets.,[20],
,Multiple KM disciplines exist; approaches vary by author and school.,[16],[21], As the discipline matured, academic debates increased regarding ,theory, and practice, including:,
,
,Techno-centric, with a focus on technology, ideally those that enhance ,knowledge sharing, and creation.,[22],[23],
,Organisational, with a focus on how an organisation can be designed to facilitate knowledge processes best.,[6],
,Ecological, with a focus on the interaction of people, ,identity,, knowledge, and environmental factors as a ,complex adaptive system, akin to a natural ,ecosystem,.,[24],[25],
,
,Regardless of the ,school of thought,, core components of KM roughly include people/culture, processes/structure and technology. The details depend on the ,perspective,.,[26], KM perspectives include:,
,
,community of practice,[27],
,social network analysis,[28],
,intellectual capital,[29],
,information theory,[14],[15],
,complexity science,[30],
,constructivism,[31],[32],
,
,The practical relevance of academic research in KM has been questioned,[33], with ,action research, suggested as having more relevance,[34], and the need to translate the findings presented in academic journals to a practice.,[12],
,Dimensions,[,edit,],
,Different ,frameworks, for distinguishing between different 'types of' knowledge exist.,[10], One proposed framework for categorizing the ,dimensions, of knowledge distinguishes ,tacit knowledge, and ,explicit knowledge,.,[30], Tacit knowledge represents internalised knowledge that an individual may not be consciously aware of, such as to accomplish particular tasks. At the opposite end of the spectrum, explicit knowledge represents knowledge that the individual holds consciously in mental focus, in a form that can easily be communicated to others.,[16],[35],
,
,
,
,
The Knowledge Spiral as described by Nonaka & Takeuchi.,
,
,
,Ikujiro Nonaka proposed a model (,SECI,, for Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) which considers a spiraling interaction between ,explicit knowledge, and tacit knowledge.,[36], In this model, knowledge follows a cycle in which implicit knowledge is 'extracted' to become explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is 're-internalised' into implicit knowledge.,[36],
,Hayes and Walsham (2003) describe knowledge and knowledge management as two different perspectives.,[37], The content perspective suggests that knowledge is easily stored; because it may be codified, while the relational perspective recognises the contextual and relational aspects of knowledge which can make knowledge difficult to share outside the specific context in which it is developed.,[37],
,Early research suggested that KM needs to convert internalised tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge to share it, and the same effort must permit individuals to internalise and make personally meaningful any codified knowledge retrieved from the KM effort.,[6],[38],
,Subsequent research suggested that a distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge represented an oversimplification and that the notion of explicit knowledge is self-contradictory.,[11], Specifically, for knowledge to be made explicit, it must be translated into information (i.e., ,symbols, outside our heads).,[11],[39], More recently, together with ,Georg von Krogh, and ,Sven Voelpel,, Nonaka returned to his earlier work in an attempt to move the debate about knowledge conversion forward.,[4],[40],
,A second proposed framework for categorizing knowledge dimensions distinguishes embedded knowledge of a ,system, outside a human individual (e.g., an information system may have knowledge embedded into its design) from ,embodied knowledge, representing a learned capability of a human body's ,nervous, and ,endocrine systems,.,[41],
,A third proposed framework distinguishes between the exploratory creation of ""new knowledge"" (i.e., innovation) vs. the ,transfer, or exploitation of ""established knowledge"" within a group, organisation, or community.,[37],[42], Collaborative environments such as communities of practice or the use of ,social computing, tools can be used for both knowledge creation and transfer.,[42],
,Strategies,[,edit,],
,Knowledge may be accessed at three stages: before, during, or after KM-related activities.,[29], Organisations have tried knowledge capture ,incentives,, including making content submission mandatory and incorporating rewards into ,performance measurement, plans.,[43], Considerable controversy exists over whether such incentives work and no consensus has emerged.,[7],
,One strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge (push strategy).,[7],[44], In such an instance, individuals strive to explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository, such as a ,database,, as well as retrieving knowledge they need that other individuals have provided (codification).,[44],
,Another strategy involves individuals making knowledge requests of experts associated with a particular subject on an ad hoc basis (pull strategy).,[7],[44], In such an instance, expert individual(s) provide ,insights, to requestor (personalisation).,[30],
,Hansen et al. defined the two strategies.,[45], Codification focuses on collecting and storing codified knowledge in electronic databases to make it accessible.,[46], Codification can therefore refer to both tacit and explicit knowledge.,[47], In contrast, personalization encourages individuals to share their knowledge directly.,[46], Information technology plays a less important role, as it is only facilitates communication and knowledge sharing.,
,Other knowledge management strategies and instruments for companies include:,[7],[24],[30],
,
,Knowledge sharing (fostering a culture that encourages the sharing of information, based on the concept that knowledge is not irrevocable and should be shared and updated to remain relevant),
,Storytelling, (as a means of transferring tacit knowledge),
,Cross-project learning,
,Make knowledge-sharing as a key roles in employees' job description,
,After-action reviews,
,Knowledge mapping (a map of knowledge repositories within a company accessible by all),
,Communities of practice,
,Expert directories (to enable knowledge seeker to reach to the experts),
,Expert systems, (knowledge seeker responds to one or more specific questions to reach knowledge in a repository),
,Best practice transfer,
,Knowledge fairs,
,Competence management (systematic evaluation and planning of competences of individual organisation members),
,Proximity & architecture (the physical situation of employees can be either conducive or obstructive to knowledge sharing),
,Master–apprentice relationship, Mentor-mentee relationship, Job-shadowing,
,Collaborative software, technologies (wikis, shared bookmarking, blogs, ,social software,, etc.),
,Knowledge repositories (databases, ,bookmarking engines,, etc.),
,Measuring and reporting intellectual capital (a way of making explicit knowledge for companies),
,Knowledge brokers, (some organisational members take on responsibility for a specific ""field"" and act as first reference on a specific subject),
,Inter-project knowledge transfer,
,Intra-organizational knowledge sharing,
,Inter-organizational knowledge sharing,
,
,Motivations,[,edit,],
,Multiple ,motivation,s lead organisations to undertake KM.,[35], Typical considerations include:,[30],
,
,Making available increased knowledge content in the ,development, and provision of ,products, and ,services,
,Achieving shorter development cycles,
,Facilitating and managing innovation and organisational learning,
,Leveraging ,expertise,s across the organisation,
,Increasing ,network, ,connectivity, between internal and external individuals,
,Managing business environments and allowing employees to obtain relevant insights and ,ideas, appropriate to their work,
,Solving intractable or ,wicked problems,
,Managing intellectual capital and assets in the workforce (such as the expertise and ,know-how, possessed by key individuals or stored in repositories),
,
,KM technologies,[,edit,],
,Knowledge management (KM) technology can be categorised:,
,
,Groupware,—Software that facilitates collaboration and sharing of organisational information. One of the earliest successful products in this category was ,Lotus Notes,: it provided tools for ,threaded discussions,, ,document sharing,, organisation-wide uniform email, etc.,
,Workflow systems,—Systems that allow the representation of processes associated with the creation, use and maintenance of organisational knowledge. For example, the process to create and utilise forms and documents.,
,Content management, and ,document management, systems—Software systems that automate the process of creating web content and/or documents. Roles such as editors, graphic designers, writers and producers can be explicitly modeled along with the tasks in the process and validation criteria. Commercial vendors started either to support documents (e.g. ,Documentum,) or to support web content (e.g. ,Interwoven,) but as the Internet grew these functions merged and vendors now perform both functions.,
,Enterprise portals,—Software that aggregates information across the entire organisation or for groups such as project teams (e.g. ,Microsoft SharePoint,).,
,eLearning,—Software that enables organisations to create customised training and education. This can include lesson plans, monitoring progress and online classes.,
,Planning and ,scheduling software,—Software that automates schedule creation and maintenance (e.g. ,Microsoft Outlook,). The planning aspect can integrate with ,project management software, such as ,Microsoft Project,.,[22],
,Telepresence,—Software that enables individuals to have virtual ""face-to-face"" meetings without assembling at one location. Videoconferencing is the most obvious example.,
,
,These categories overlap. Workflow, for example, is a significant aspect of a content or document management systems, most of which have tools for developing enterprise portals.,[7],[48],
,Proprietary KM technology products such as Lotus Notes defined proprietary formats for email, documents, forms, etc. The Internet drove most vendors to adopt Internet formats. ,Open-source, and ,freeware, tools for the creation of ,blogs, and ,wikis, now enable capabilities that used to require expensive commercial tools.,[34],[49],
,KM is driving the adoption of tools that enable organisations to work at the semantic level,,[50], as part of the ,Semantic Web,:,[51], for example, the ,Stanford, ,Protégé Ontology Editor,. Some commentators have argued that after many years the Semantic Web has failed to see widespread adoption,,[52],[53],[54], while other commentators have argued that it has been a success.,[55],
,Legal knowledge management,[,edit,],
,Knowledge management in law firms has evolved through three phases.,[56],  Phase one focused primarily on the development of taxonomies to systematize attorney work product and related research.  The second phase focused on enterprise search to mine the growing volume of information managed by law firms.  Legal industry specific search engines were deployed by many AmLaw 100 law firms during this phase. Phase 3 was driven by changes in the legal market place and growing competition that led to price pressure and increased demands for efficiency from clients. A major focus of law firm KM today is in using historical billing information to generate alternative fee arrangements and more generally in the area of legal project management to more efficiently deliver legal services to clients.,

,A ,blog, (a ,truncation, of the expression "",weblog,""),[1], is a discussion or informational ,website, published on the ,World Wide Web, consisting of discrete, often informal ,diary,-style text entries (""posts""). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,,[,citation needed,], occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, ""multi-author blogs"" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from ,newspapers,, other media outlets, ,universities,, ,think tanks,, ,advocacy groups,, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of ,Twitter, and other "",microblogging,"" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. ,Blog, can also be used as a verb, meaning ,to maintain or add content to a blog,.,
,The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with ,HTML, or ,computer programming,. Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as ,HTML, and ,File Transfer Protocol, had been required to publish content on the Web, and as such, early Web users tended to be ,hackers, and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive ,Web 2.0, websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.,[2], In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of ,social networking service,. Indeed, bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs, but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.,[3], However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.,
,Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from politics to sports. Others function as more personal ,online diaries,, and others function more as ,online brand advertising, of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, ,web pages,, and other media related to its topic. The ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact with other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove ,hate speech, or other offensive content. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (,art blogs,), photographs (,photoblogs,), videos (,video blogs, or ""vlogs""), music (,MP3 blogs,), and audio (,podcasts,). In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources. These blogs are referred to as ,edublogs,. ,Microblogging, is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.,
,On 16 February 2011,[update],, there were over 156 million public blogs in existence. On 20 February 2014, there were around 172 million ,Tumblr,[4], and 75.8 million ,WordPress,[5], blogs in existence worldwide. According to critics and other bloggers, ,Blogger, is the most popular blogging service used today. However, Blogger does not offer public statistics.,[6],[7], ,Technorati, lists 1.3 million blogs as of February 22, 2014.,[8],

Early example of a ""diary"" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in ,real time, from a ,wearable computer, with ,head-up display,, 22 February 1995,
,
,
,Main articles: ,History of blogging, and ,online diary,
,The term ""weblog"" was coined by ,Jorn Barger,[9], on 17 December 1997. The short form, ""blog"", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word ,weblog, into the phrase ,we blog, in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.,[10],[11],[12], Shortly thereafter, ,Evan Williams, at ,Pyra Labs, used ""blog"" as both a noun and verb (""to blog"", meaning ""to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog"") and devised the term ""blogger"" in connection with Pyra Labs' ,Blogger, product, leading to the popularization of the terms.,[13],
,Origins,
,Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including ,Usenet,, commercial online services such as ,GEnie,, ,Byte Information Exchange, (BIX) and the early ,CompuServe,, ,e-mail lists,,,[14], and ,Bulletin Board Systems, (BBS). In the 1990s, ,Internet forum, software, created running conversations with ""threads"". Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual "",corkboard,"". From 14 June 1993, Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their ""What’s New"",[15], list of new websites, updated daily and archived monthly. The page was accessible by a special ""What's New"" button in the Mosaic web browser.,
,The modern blog evolved from the ,online diary,, where people would keep a running account of the events in their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, ,journalists,, or journalers. ,Justin Hall,, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at ,Swarthmore College,, is generally recognized as one of the earlier bloggers,,[16], as is ,Jerry Pournelle,.,[17], ,Dave Winer,'s Scripting News is also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs.,[18],[19], The Australian Netguide magazine maintained the Daily Net News,[20], on their web site from 1996. Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites, mostly in Australia.,
,Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and ,EyeTap, device to a web site in 1994. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as ,sousveillance,, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters. Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common ,Websites,. However, the evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of ""blogging"". Blogs can be hosted by dedicated ,blog hosting services,, or they can be run using blog software, or on regular ,web hosting services,. Some early bloggers, such as ,The Misanthropic Bitch,, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a ,zine,, before the term blog entered common usage.,
,Rise in popularity,
,After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:,
,
,Bruce Ableson, launched ,Open Diary, in October 1998, which soon grew to thousands of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers' blog entries.,
,Brad Fitzpatrick, started ,LiveJournal, in March 1999.,
,Andrew Smales created Pitas.com in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a ""news page"" on a Web site, followed by DiaryLand in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.,[21],
,Evan Williams, and ,Meg Hourihan, (,Pyra Labs,) launched ,Blogger.com, in August 1999 (purchased by ,Google, in February 2003),
,
,Political impact,
,
,
,
,
On 6 December 2002, Josh Marshall's talkingpointsmemo.com blog called attention to U.S. Senator ,Lott's, comments regarding Senator Thurmond. Senator Lott was eventually to resign his Senate leadership position over the matter.,
,
,
,An early milestone in the rise in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by ,U.S. Senate Majority Leader, ,Trent Lott,.,[22], Senator Lott, at a party honoring ,U.S. Senator, ,Strom Thurmond,, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of ,racial segregation,, a policy advocated by Thurmond's ,1948 presidential campaign,. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See ,Josh Marshall,'s ,Talking Points Memo,.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.,
,Similarly, blogs were among the driving forces behind the "",Rathergate,"" scandal. To wit: (television journalist) ,Dan Rather, presented documents (on the CBS show ,60 Minutes,) that conflicted with accepted accounts of President Bush's military service record. Bloggers declared the documents to be ,forgeries, and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view. Consequently, CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see ,Little Green Footballs,). Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a news source and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.,[,original research?,], The impact of these stories gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips,,[,citation needed,], bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media. Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis.,[,original research?,],
,In ,Russia,, some political bloggers have started to challenge the dominance of official, overwhelmingly pro-government media. Bloggers such as ,Rustem Adagamov, and ,Alexei Navalny, have many followers and the latter's nickname for the ruling ,United Russia, party as the ""party of crooks and thieves"" has been adopted by anti-regime protesters.,[23], This led to the ,Wall Street Journal, calling Navalny ""the man ,Vladimir Putin, fears most"" in March 2012.,[24],
,Mainstream popularity,
,By 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as ,political consultants,, news services, and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Blogging was established by politicians and political candidates to express opinions on war and other issues and cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See ,Howard Dean, and ,Wesley Clark,.) Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the ,UK's Labour Party's, ,MP, ,Tom Watson,, began to blog to bond with constituents. In January 2005, ,Fortune, magazine listed eight bloggers whom business people ""could not ignore"": ,Peter Rojas,, ,Xeni Jardin,, ,Ben Trott,, ,Mena Trott,, ,Jonathan Schwartz,, Jason Goldman, ,Robert Scoble,, and ,Jason Calacanis,.,[25],
,Israel, was among the first national governments to set up an official blog.,[26], Under ,David Saranga,, the ,Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, became active in adopting ,Web 2.0, initiatives, including an official ,video blog,[26], and a ,political blog,.,[27], The Foreign Ministry also held a ,microblogging, press conference via ,Twitter, about its ,war with Hamas,, with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide ,press conference,.,[28], The questions and answers were later posted on ,IsraelPolitik,, the country's official political blog.,[29],
,The impact of blogging upon the mainstream media has also been acknowledged by governments. In 2009, the presence of the American journalism industry had declined to the point that several newspaper corporations were filing for bankruptcy, resulting in less direct competition between newspapers within the same circulation area. Discussion emerged as to whether the newspaper industry would benefit from a stimulus package by the federal government. U.S. President ,Barack Obama, acknowledged the emerging influence of blogging upon society by saying ""if the direction of the news is all blogosphere, all opinions, with no serious fact-checking, no serious attempts to put stories in context, then what you will end up getting is people shouting at each other across the void but not a lot of mutual understanding”.,[30], Between 2009 and 2012, an ,Orwell Prize, for blogging was awarded.,
,Types,
,
,
,
,
A screenshot from the BlogActive website.,
,
,
,There are many different types of blogs, differing not only in the type of content, but also in the way that content is delivered or written.,
,
,Personal blogs,
,The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual, rather than a corporation or organization. While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers, other than the blogger's immediate family and friends, a small number of personal blogs have become popular, to the point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship. A tiny number of personal bloggers have become famous, both in the online community and in the real world.,
,
,
,Collaborative blogs or group blogs,
,A type of weblog in which posts are written and published by more than one author. The majority of high-profile collaborative blogs are based around a single uniting theme, such as politics, technology or advocacy. In recent years, the ,blogosphere, has seen the emergence and growing popularity of more collaborative efforts, often set up by already established bloggers wishing to pool time and resources, both to reduce the pressure of maintaining a popular website and to attract a larger readership.,
,
,
,Microblogging,
,Microblogging is the practice of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures, links, short videos, or other media—on the Internet. Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users. It has captured the public imagination, in part because the short posts are easy to read on the go or when waiting. Friends use it to keep in touch, business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their publicists) microblog about concert dates, lectures, book releases, or tour schedules. A wide and growing range of add-on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications. The resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication.,[31], Examples of these include ,Twitter,, ,Facebook,, ,Tumblr, and, by far the largest, ,WeiBo,.,
,
,
,Corporate and organizational blogs,
,A blog can be private, as in most cases, or it can be for ,business, or ,not-for-profit organization, or ,government, purposes. Blogs used internally, and only available to employees via an ,Intranet, are called ,corporate blogs,. Companies use internal corporate blogs enhance the communication, culture and ,employee engagement, in a ,corporation,. Internal corporate blogs can be used to communicate news about company policies or procedures, build employee ,esprit de corps, and improve ,morale,. Companies and other organizations also use external, publicly accessible blogs for ,marketing,, ,branding,, or ,public relations, purposes. Some organizations have a blog authored by their executive; in practice, many of these executive blog posts are penned by a ,ghostwriter,, who makes posts in the style of the credited author. Similar blogs for clubs and societies are called club blogs, group blogs, or by similar names; typical use is to inform members and other interested parties of club and member activities.,
,
,
,Aggregated blogs,
,Individuals or organization may aggregate selected feeds on specific topic, product or service and provide combined view for its readers. This allows readers to concentrate on reading instead of searching for quality on-topic content and managing subscriptions. Many such aggregation called planets from name of ,Planet (software), that perform such aggregation, hosting sites usually have ,planet., ,subdomain, in ,domain name, (like ,http://planet.gnome.org/,).,
,
,
,By ,genre,
,Some blogs focus on a particular subject, such as ,political blogs,, journalism blogs, ,health blogs,, ,travel blogs, (also known as ,travelogs,), gardening blogs, house blogs, ,book blogs,,,[32],[33], ,fashion blogs,, beauty blogs, lifestyle blogs, party blogs, wedding blogs, photography blogs, ,project blogs,, psychology blogs, sociology blogs, ,education blogs,, ,niche blogs,, ,classical music blogs,, quizzing blogs, ,legal blogs, (often referred to as a blawgs), or ,dreamlogs,. ,How-to,/,Tutorial, blogs are becoming increasing popular.,[34], Two common types of genre blogs are ,art blogs, and ,music blogs,. A blog featuring discussions especially about ,home, and ,family, is not uncommonly called a ,mom blog, and one made popular is by ,Erica Diamond, who created Womenonthefence.com which is syndicated to over two million readers monthly.,[35],[36],[37],[38],[39],[40], While not a legitimate type of blog, one used for the sole purpose of spamming is known as a ,splog,.,
,
,
,By media type,
,A blog comprising videos is called a ,vlog,, one comprising links is called a ,linklog,, a site containing a portfolio of sketches is called a ,sketchblog, or one comprising photos is called a ,photoblog,. Blogs with shorter posts and mixed media types are called ,tumblelogs,. Blogs that are written on typewriters and then scanned are called ,typecast, or typecast blogs. A rare type of blog hosted on the ,Gopher Protocol, is known as a ,phlog,.,
,
,
,By device,
,A blog can also be defined by which type of device is used to compose it. A blog written by a ,mobile device, like a ,mobile phone, or ,PDA, could be called a ,moblog,.,[41], One early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal life combining text, video, and pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and ,EyeTap, device to a web site. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as ,sousveillance,. Such journals have been used as evidence in legal matters.,[,citation needed,],
,
,
,Reverse blog,
,A reverse blog is composed by its users rather than a single blogger. This system has the characteristics of a blog, and the writing of several authors. These can be written by several contributing authors on a topic, or opened up for anyone to write. There is typically some limit to the number of entries to keep it from operating like a ,web forum,.,[,citation needed,],

An artist's depiction of the interconnections between blogs and blog authors in the "",blogosphere,"" in 2007.,
,
,
,
,Blogosphere,
,The collective community of all blogs and blog authors, particularly notable and widely read blogs, is known as the ,blogosphere,. Since all blogs are on the internet by definition, they may be seen as interconnected and socially networked, through blogrolls, comments, ,linkbacks, (refbacks, trackbacks or pingbacks), and backlinks. Discussions ""in the blogosphere"" are occasionally used by the media as a gauge of public opinion on various issues. Because new, untapped communities of bloggers and their readers can emerge in the space of a few years, ,Internet marketers, pay close attention to ""trends in the blogosphere"".,[42],
,
,
,Blog search engines,
,Several blog search engines have been used to search blog contents, such as ,Bloglines,, ,BlogScope,, and ,Technorati,. Technorati was one of the more popular blog search engines, but the website stopped indexing blogs and assigning authority scores in May 2014. The research community is working on going beyond simple keyword search, by inventing new ways to navigate through huge amounts of information present in the ,blogosphere,, as demonstrated by projects like ,BlogScope,, which was shut down in 2012.,[,citation needed,],
,
,
,Blogging communities and directories,
,Several ,online communities, exist that connect people to blogs and bloggers to other bloggers. Some of these communities include Indiblogger, Blogadda, Blog Chatter, BlogCatalog and ,MyBlogLog,.,[43], Interest-specific blogging platforms are also available. For instance, Blogster has a sizable community of political bloggers among its members. ,Global Voices, aggregates international bloggers, ""with emphasis on voices that are not ordinarily heard in international mainstream media."",[44],
,
,
,Blogging and ,advertising,
,It is common for blogs to feature ,banner advertisements, or promotional content, either to financially benefit the blogger, support website hosting costs, or to promote the blogger's favorite causes or products. The popularity of blogs has also given rise to ,""fake blogs"", in which a company will create a fictional blog as a marketing tool to promote a product.,[45],
,
,As the popularity of blogging continues to rise, the commercialisation of blogging is rapidly increasing. Many corporations and companies collaborate with bloggers to increase advertising and engage online communities towards their products. In the book ,Fans, Bloggers, and Gamers,, Henry Jenkins stated that ""Bloggers take knowledge in their own hands, enabling successful navigation within and between these emerging knowledge cultures. One can see such behaviour as co-optation into commodity culture insofar as it sometimes collaborates with corporate interests, but one can also see it as increasing the diversity of media culture, providing opportunities for greater inclusiveness, and making more responsive to consumers."",[46],

,As of 2008, blogging had become such a mania that a new blog was created every second of every minute of every hour of every day.,[47], Researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e., blogroll). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, ,permalinks, can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.,[48],
,The ,blogdex, project was launched by researchers in the ,MIT Media Lab, to crawl the Web and gather data from thousands of blogs in order to investigate their social properties. Information was gathered by the tool for over four years, during which it autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community, ranking it by recency and popularity. It can, therefore,,[,original research?,], be considered the first instantiation of a ,memetracker,. The project was replaced by ,tailrank.com, which in turn has been replaced by spinn3r.com.,
,Blogs are given rankings by ,Alexa Internet, (web hits of Alexa Toolbar users), and formerly by blog search engine ,Technorati, based on the number of incoming links (Technorati stopped doing this in 2014). In August 2006, Technorati found that the most linked-to blog on the internet was that of Chinese actress ,Xu Jinglei,.,[49], Chinese media ,Xinhua, reported that this blog received more than 50 million page views, claiming it to be the most popular blog in the world.,[50], Technorati rated ,Boing Boing, to be the most-read group-written blog.,[49],
,Blurring with the mass media,
,Many bloggers, particularly those engaged in ,participatory journalism,, are amateur journalists, and thus they differentiate themselves from the professional reporters and editors who work in ,mainstream media, organizations. Other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online, rather than via a TV station or newspaper, either as an add-on to a traditional media presence (e.g., hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper), or as their sole journalistic output. Some institutions and organizations see blogging as a means of ""getting around the filter"" of media "",gatekeepers,"" and pushing their ,messages, directly to the public. Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs—well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list.,[,citation needed,], The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when ,Jonathan Dube, of The ,Charlotte Observer, published one chronicling ,Hurricane Bonnie,.,[51],
,Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: ,Duncan Black, (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), ,Glenn Reynolds, (,Instapundit,), ,Markos Moulitsas Zúniga, (,Daily Kos,), ,Alex Steffen, (,Worldchanging,), ,Ana Marie Cox, (,Wonkette,), ,Nate Silver, (,FiveThirtyEight.com,), and ,Ezra Klein, (Ezra Klein blog in ,The American Prospect,,, now in the ,Washington Post,). In counterpoint, ,Hugh Hewitt, exemplifies a mass media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in ""old media"" by being an influential blogger. Similarly, it was ,Emergency Preparedness and Safety Tips On Air and Online, blog articles that captured ,Surgeon General of the United States, ,Richard Carmona,'s attention and earned his kudos for the associated broadcasts by talk show host ,Lisa Tolliver, and Westchester Emergency Volunteer Reserves-,Medical Reserve Corps, Director Marianne Partridge.,[52],[53],[54],[55],
,Blogs have also had an influence on ,minority languages,, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in ,Gaelic languages,. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging. There are examples of bloggers who have published books based on their blogs, e.g., ,Salam Pax,, ,Ellen Simonetti,, ,Jessica Cutler,, ,ScrappleFace,. Blog-based books have been given the name ,blook,. A prize for the best blog-based book was initiated in 2005,,[56], the ,Lulu Blooker Prize,.,[57], However, success has been elusive offline, with many of these books not selling as well as their blogs. The book based on ,Julie Powell,'s blog ""The Julie/Julia Project"" was made into the film ,Julie & Julia,, apparently the first to do so.,
,Consumer-generated advertising,
,Consumer-generated advertising, is a relatively new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the ,sponsored posts,.,[58], These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some ,disintermediation, and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, to take advantage of this new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.,[59],
,Legal and social consequences,
, Blogging can result in a range of legal liabilities and other unforeseen consequences.,[60],
,Defamation or liability,
,Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of ,defamation or liability,. U.S. payouts related to blogging totaled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by ,umbrella insurance,.,[61], The courts have returned with mixed verdicts. ,Internet Service Providers, (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. ,Communications Decency Act, and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC). In ,Doe v. Cahill,, the ,Delaware Supreme Court, held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the ,anonymous bloggers,, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the ,trial court, for reconsideration.,[62], In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.,
,In January 2007, two prominent ,Malaysian, political bloggers, ,Jeff Ooi, and ,Ahirudin Attan,, were sued by a pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over an alleged defamation. The plaintiff was supported by the Malaysian government.,[63], Following the suit, the Malaysian government proposed to ""register"" all bloggers in Malaysia in order to better control parties against their interest.,[64], This is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country. In the United States, blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for ,defamation, and publication of ,trade secrets, in 2005.,[65], According to ,Wired, magazine, Traffic Power had been ""banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results."",[66], Wall and other "",white hat,"" ,search engine optimization, consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public. The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time.,[67],
,In 2009, ,NDTV, issued a legal notice to Indian blogger Kunte for a blog post criticizing their coverage of the ,Mumbai attacks,.,[68], The blogger unconditionally withdrew his post, which resulted in several Indian bloggers criticizing NDTV for trying to silence critics.,[69],
,Employment,
,Employees who blog about elements of their place of employment can begin to affect the reputation of their employer, either in a positive way, if the employee is praising the employer and its workplaces, or in a negative way, if the blogger is making negative comments about the company or its practices.,
,In general, attempts by employee bloggers to protect themselves by maintaining anonymity have proved ineffective.,[70], In 2009, a controversial and landmark decision by ,The Hon. Mr Justice Eady, refused to grant an order to protect the anonymity of ,Richard Horton,. Horton was a police officer in the United Kingdom who blogged about his job under the name ""NightJack"".,[71],
,Delta Air Lines, fired ,flight attendant, ,Ellen Simonetti, because she posted photographs of herself in uniform on an airplane and because of comments posted on her blog ""Queen of Sky: Diary of a Flight Attendant"" which the employer deemed inappropriate.,[72],[73], This case highlighted the issue of personal blogging and freedom of expression versus employer rights and responsibilities, and so it received wide media attention. Simonetti took legal action against the airline for ""wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages"".,[74], The suit was postponed while Delta was in bankruptcy proceedings.,[75],
,In early 2006, Erik Ringmar, a senior lecturer at the ,London School of Economics,, was ordered by the convenor of his department to ""take down and destroy"" his blog in which he discussed the quality of education at the school.,[76],
,Mark Jen was terminated in 2005 after 10 days of employment as an assistant product manager at ,Google, for discussing corporate secrets on his personal blog, then called 99zeros and hosted on the Google-owned ,Blogger, service.,[77], He blogged about unreleased products and company finances a week before the company's earnings announcement. He was fired two days after he complied with his employer's request to remove the sensitive material from his blog.,[78],
,In India, blogger Gaurav Sabnis resigned from ,IBM, after his posts questioned the claims made by a management school.,[79], ,Jessica Cutler,, aka ""The Washingtonienne"",,[80], blogged about her sex life while employed as a congressional assistant. After the blog was discovered and she was fired,,[81], she wrote a novel based on her experiences and blog: ,The Washingtonienne: A Novel,. As of 2006,[update],, Cutler is being sued by one of her former lovers in a case that could establish the extent to which bloggers are obligated to protect the privacy of their real life associates.,[82],
,Catherine Sanderson, a.k.a. ,Petite Anglaise,, lost her job in Paris at a British accountancy firm because of blogging.,[83], Although given in the blog in a fairly anonymous manner, some of the descriptions of the firm and some of its people were less than flattering. Sanderson later won a compensation claim case against the British firm, however.,[84],
,On the other hand, ,Penelope Trunk, wrote an upbeat article in the ,Boston Globe, in 2006, entitled ""Blogs 'essential' to a good career"".,[85], She was one of the first journalists to point out that a large portion of bloggers are professionals and that a well-written blog can help attract employers.,
,Business owners,
,Business owners who blog about their business can also run into legal consequences. ,Mark Cuban,, owner of the ,Dallas Mavericks,, was fined during the 2006 ,NBA, playoffs for criticizing NBA officials on the court and in his blog.,[86],
,Political dangers,
,See also: ,Political repression of cyber-dissidents,
,Blogging can sometimes have unforeseen consequences in politically sensitive areas. In some countries, ,Internet police, or ,secret police, may monitor blogs and arrest blog authors of commentators. Blogs can be much harder to control than broadcast or print media, because a person can create a blog whose authorship is hard to trace, by using anonymity technology such as ,Tor,. As a result, ,totalitarian, and ,authoritarian, regimes often seek to suppress blogs and/or to punish those who maintain them.,
,In ,Singapore,, two ethnic Chinese individuals were ,imprisoned, under the country’s ,anti-sedition law, for posting ,anti-Muslim, remarks in their blogs.,[87], ,Egyptian, blogger ,Kareem Amer, was charged with insulting the Egyptian president ,Hosni Mubarak, and an ,Islamic, ,institution, through his blog. It is the first time in the history of Egypt that a blogger was prosecuted. After a brief trial session that took place in ,Alexandria,, the blogger was found guilty and sentenced to prison terms of three years for insulting ,Islam, and inciting sedition, and one year for insulting Mubarak.,[88], Egyptian blogger Abdel Monem Mahmoud was arrested in April 2007 for anti-government writings in his blog.,[89], Monem is a member of the then banned ,Muslim Brotherhood,. After the ,2011 Egyptian revolution,, the Egyptian blogger ,Maikel Nabil Sanad, was charged with insulting the military for an article he wrote on his personal blog and sentenced to 3 years.,[90],
,After expressing opinions in his personal blog about the state of the Sudanese armed forces, ,Jan Pronk,, ,United Nations, Special Representative for the ,Sudan,, was given three days notice to leave Sudan. The Sudanese army had demanded his deportation.,[91],[92], In ,Myanmar,, Nay Phone Latt, a blogger, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for posting a cartoon critical of head of state ,Than Shwe,.,[93],
,Personal safety,
,See also: ,Cyberstalking, and ,Internet homicide,
,One consequence of blogging is the possibility of online or in-person attacks or threats against the blogger, sometimes without apparent reason. In some cases, bloggers have faced ,cyberbullying,. ,Kathy Sierra,, author of the blog ""Creating Passionate Users"",,[94], was the target of threats and ,misogynistic, insults to the point that she canceled her keynote speech at a technology conference in San Diego, fearing for her safety.,[95], While a blogger's anonymity is often tenuous, ,Internet trolls, who would attack a blogger with threats or insults can be emboldened by the anonymity of the online environment, where some users are known only by a ,pseudonymous, ""username"" (e.g., ""Hacker1984""). Sierra and supporters initiated an online discussion aimed at countering abusive online behavior,[96], and developed a ,Blogger's Code of Conduct,, which set out a ,rules for behaviour, in the online space.,
,Behavior,
,The ,Blogger's Code of Conduct, is a proposal by ,Tim O'Reilly, for bloggers to enforce civility on their blogs by being civil themselves and moderating comments on their blog. The code was proposed in 2007 due to threats made to blogger ,Kathy Sierra,.,[97], The idea of the code was first reported by ,BBC News,, who quoted O'Reilly saying, ""I do think we need some code of conduct around what is acceptable behaviour, I would hope that it doesn't come through any kind of regulation it would come through self-regulation."",[98],
,O'Reilly and others came up with a list of seven proposed ideas:,[99],[100],[101],[102],
,
,Take responsibility not just for your own words, but for the comments you allow on your blog.,
,Label your tolerance level for abusive comments.,
,Consider eliminating anonymous comments.,
,Ignore the ,trolls,.,
,Take the conversation offline, and talk directly, or find an intermediary who can do so.,
,If you know someone who is behaving badly, tell them so.,
,Don't say anything online that you wouldn't say in person.,
,
,These ideas were predictably intensely discussed on the Web and in the media. While the internet has continued to grow, with online activity and discourse only picking up both in positive and negative ways in terms of blog interaction, the proposed Code has drawn more widespread attention to the necessity of monitoring blogging activity and social norms being as important online as offline.,
