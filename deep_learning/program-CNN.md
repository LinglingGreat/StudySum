# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Zero-Padding

The main benefits of padding are the following:

- It allows you to use a CONV layer without necessarily shrinking the height and width of the volumes. This is important for building deeper networks, since otherwise the height/width would shrink as you go to deeper layers. An important special case is the "same" convolution, in which the height/width is exactly preserved after one layer.
- It helps us keep more of the information at the border of an image. Without padding, very few values at the next layer would be affected by pixels as the edges of an image.

**Exercise**: Implement the following function, which pads all the images of a batch of examples X with zeros. [Use np.pad](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html). Note if you want to pad the array "a" of shape (5,5,5,5,5)(5,5,5,5,5) with `pad = 1` for the 2nd dimension, `pad = 3` for the 4th dimension and `pad = 0` for the rest, you would do:

```
a = np.pad(a, ((0,0), (1,1), (0,0), (3,3), (0,0)), 'constant', constant_values = (..,..))
```

```Python
def zero_pad(X, pad):
    """
    Pad with zeros all images of the dataset X. The padding is applied to the height and width of an image, 
    as illustrated in Figure 1.
    
    Argument:
    X -- python numpy array of shape (m, n_H, n_W, n_C) representing a batch of m images
    pad -- integer, amount of padding around each image on vertical and horizontal dimensions
    
    Returns:
    X_pad -- padded image of shape (m, n_H + 2*pad, n_W + 2*pad, n_C)
    """
    
    X_pad = np.pad(X, ((0, 0),(pad, pad),(pad, pad),(0, 0)), 'constant', constant_values=0)
    
    return X_pad
```

## Single step of convolution

In this part, implement a single step of convolution, in which you apply the filter to a single position of the input. This will be used to build a convolutional unit, which:

- Takes an input volume
- Applies a filter at every position of the input
- Outputs another volume (usually of different size)

```python
def conv_single_step(a_slice_prev, W, b):
    """
    Apply one filter defined by parameters W on a single slice (a_slice_prev) of the output activation 
    of the previous layer.
    
    Arguments:
    a_slice_prev -- slice of input data of shape (f, f, n_C_prev)
    W -- Weight parameters contained in a window - matrix of shape (f, f, n_C_prev)
    b -- Bias parameters contained in a window - matrix of shape (1, 1, 1)
    
    Returns:
    Z -- a scalar value, result of convolving the sliding window (W, b) on a slice x of the input data
    """

    # Element-wise product between a_slice and W. Add bias.
    s = np.multiply(a_slice_prev, W) + b
    # Sum over all entries of the volume s
    Z = np.sum(s)

    return Z
```

```python
# test function conv_single_step()
np.random.seed(1)
a_slice_prev = np.random.randn(4, 4, 3)
W = np.random.randn(4, 4, 3)
b = np.random.randn(1, 1, 1)

Z = conv_single_step(a_slice_prev, W, b)
print("Z =", Z)
```

## Convolutional Neural Networks - Forward pass

In the forward pass, you will take many filters and convolve them on the input. Each 'convolution' gives you a 2D matrix output. You will then stack these outputs to get a 3D volume 

**Exercise**: Implement the function below to convolve the filters W on an input activation A_prev. This function takes as input A_prev, the activations output by the previous layer (for a batch of m inputs), F filters/weights denoted by W, and a bias vector denoted by b, where each filter has its own (single) bias. Finally you also have access to the hyperparameters dictionary which contains the stride and the padding. 

**Reminder**:
The formulas relating the output shape of the convolution to the input shape is:
$$ n_H = \lfloor \frac{n_{H_{prev}} - f + 2 \times pad}{stride} \rfloor +1 $$
$$ n_W = \lfloor \frac{n_{W_{prev}} - f + 2 \times pad}{stride} \rfloor +1 $$
$$ n_C = \text{number of filters used in the convolution}$$

For this exercise, we won't worry about vectorization, and will just implement everything with for-loops.

```python
def conv_forward(A_prev, W, b, hparameters):
    """

                    vert_end = vert_start + f
                    horiz_start = w * stride

                    Z[i, h, w, c] = np.sum(np.multiply(a_slice_prev, W[:, :, :, c]) + b[:, :, :, c])
    
    # Making sure your output shape is correct
    assert(Z.shape == (m, n_H, n_W, n_C))
    
    # Save information in "cache" for the backprop
    cache = (A_prev, W, b, hparameters)
    
    return Z, cache
```

```python
# test
np.random.seed(1)
A_prev = np.random.randn(10,4,4,3)
W = np.random.randn(2,2,3,8)
b = np.random.randn(1,1,1,8)
hparameters = {"pad" : 2,
               "stride": 1}

Z, cache_conv = conv_forward(A_prev, W, b, hparameters)
print("Z's mean =", np.mean(Z))
print("cache_conv[0][1][2][3] =", cache_conv[0][1][2][3])
```

Finally, CONV layer should also contain an activation, in which case we would add the following line of code:

```
# Convolve the window to get back one output neuron
Z[i, h, w, c] = ...
# Apply activation
A[i, h, w, c] = activation(Z[i, h, w, c])
```

# Pooling layer

The pooling (POOL) layer reduces the height and width of the input. It helps reduce computation, as well as helps make feature detectors more invariant to its position in the input. The two types of pooling layers are:

- Max-pooling layer: slides an (f,f) window over the input and stores the max value of the window in the output.
- Average-pooling layer: slides an (f,f) window over the input and stores the average value of the window in the output.

These pooling layers have no parameters for backpropagation to train. However, they have hyperparameters such as the window size f. This specifies the height and width of the fxf window you would compute a max or average over. 

## Forward Pooling

**Reminder**:
As there's no padding, the formulas binding the output shape of the pooling to the input shape is:
$$ n_H = \lfloor \frac{n_{H_{prev}} - f}{stride} \rfloor +1 $$
$$ n_W = \lfloor \frac{n_{W_{prev}} - f}{stride} \rfloor +1 $$
$$ n_C = n_{C_{prev}}$$

```python

# Backpropagation in convolutional neural networks

## Convolutional layer backward pass

#### Computing dA:
This is the formula for computing $dA$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$ and a given training example:

$$ dA += \sum _{h=0} ^{n_H} \sum_{w=0} ^{n_W} W_c \times dZ_{hw} \tag{1}$$

Where $W_c$ is a filter and $dZ_{hw}$ is a scalar corresponding to the gradient of the cost with respect to the output of the conv layer Z at the hth row and wth column (corresponding to the dot product taken at the ith stride left and jth stride down). Note that at each time, we multiply the the same filter $W_c$ by a different dZ when updating dA. We do so mainly because when computing the forward propagation, each filter is dotted and summed by a different a_slice. Therefore when computing the backprop for dA, we are just adding the gradients of all the a_slices. 

In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:
```python
da_prev_pad[vert_start:vert_end, horiz_start:horiz_end, :] += W[:,:,:,c] * dZ[i, h, w, c]
```

#### Computing dW:
This is the formula for computing $dW_c$ ($dW_c$ is the derivative of one filter) with respect to the loss:

$$ dW_c  += \sum _{h=0} ^{n_H} \sum_{w=0} ^ {n_W} a_{slice} \times dZ_{hw}  \tag{2}$$

Where $a_{slice}$ corresponds to the slice which was used to generate the acitivation $Z_{ij}$. Hence, this ends up giving us the gradient for $W$ with respect to that slice. Since it is the same $W$, we will just add up all such gradients to get $dW$. 

In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:
```python
dW[:,:,:,c] += a_slice * dZ[i, h, w, c]
```

#### Computing db:

This is the formula for computing $db$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$:

$$ db = \sum_h \sum_w dZ_{hw} \tag{3}$$

As you have previously seen in basic neural networks, db is computed by summing $dZ$. In this case, you are just summing over all the gradients of the conv output (Z) with respect to the cost. 

In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:
```python
db[:,:,:,c] += dZ[i, h, w, c]
```

**Exercise**: Implement the `conv_backward` function below. You should sum over all the training examples, filters, heights, and widths. You should then compute the derivatives using formulas 1, 2 and 3 above.

## Pooling layer - backward pass

Even though a pooling layer has no parameters for backprop to update, you still need to backpropagation the gradient through the pooling layer in order to compute gradients for layers that came before the pooling layer. 

**Max pooling - backward pass**

Before jumping into the backpropagation of the pooling layer, you are going to build a helper function called `create_mask_from_window()` which does the following: 

$$ X = \begin{bmatrix}1 && 3 \\4 && 2\end{bmatrix} \quad \rightarrow  \quad M =\begin{bmatrix}0 && 0 \\1 && 0\end{bmatrix}\tag{4}$$

As you can see, this function creates a "mask" matrix which keeps track of where the maximum of the matrix is. True (1) indicates the position of the maximum in X, the other entries are False (0). You'll see later that the backward pass for average pooling will be similar to this but using a different mask.  

**Exercise**: Implement `create_mask_from_window()`. This function will be helpful for pooling backward. 
Hints:
- [np.max()]() may be helpful. It computes the maximum of an array.
- If you have a matrix X and a scalar x: `A = (X == x)` will return a matrix A of the same size as X such that:
```
A[i,j] = True if X[i,j] = x
A[i,j] = False if X[i,j] != x
```
- Here, you don't need to consider cases where there are several maxima in a matrix.

```python
def create_mask_from_window(x):
    """
    Creates a mask from an input matrix x, to identify the max entry of x.
    
    Arguments:
    x -- Array of shape (f, f)
    
    Returns:
    mask -- Array of the same shape as window, contains a True at the position corresponding to the max entry of x.
    """
    
    mask = (x == np.max(x))
    
    return mask
```

```python
# test
np.random.seed(1)
x = np.random.randn(2,3)
mask = create_mask_from_window(x)
print('x = ', x)
print("mask = ", mask)
```

Why do we keep track of the position of the max? It's because this is the input value that ultimately influenced the output, and therefore the cost. Backprop is computing gradients with respect to the cost, so anything that influences the ultimate cost should have a non-zero gradient. So, backprop will "propagate" the gradient back to this particular input value that had influenced the cost. 

**Average pooling - backward pass**

In max pooling, for each input window, all the "influence" on the output came from a single input value--the max. In average pooling, every element of the input window has equal influence on the output. So to implement backprop, you will now implement a helper function that reflects this.

For example if we did average pooling in the forward pass using a 2x2 filter, then the mask you'll use for the backward pass will look like: 
$$ dZ = 1 \quad \rightarrow  \quad dZ =\begin{bmatrix}1/4 && 1/4 \\1/4 && 1/4\end{bmatrix}\tag{5}$$

This implies that each position in the $dZ$ matrix contributes equally to output because in the forward pass, we took an average. 

**Exercise**: Implement the function below to equally distribute a value dz through a matrix of dimension shape. [Hint](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html)

```python
def distribute_value(dz, shape):
    """
    Distributes the input value in the matrix of dimension shape
    
    Arguments:
    dz -- input scalar
    shape -- the shape (n_H, n_W) of the output matrix for which we want to distribute the value of dz
    
    Returns:
    a -- Array of size (n_H, n_W) for which we distributed the value of dz
    """
    
    # Retrieve dimensions from shape (≈1 line)
    (n_H, n_W) = shape
    
    # Compute the value to distribute on the matrix (≈1 line)
    average = dz / (n_H * n_W)
    
    # Create a matrix where every entry is the "average" value (≈1 line)
    a = np.ones(shape) * average
    
    return a
```

```python
a = distribute_value(2, (2,2))
print('distributed value =', a)
```

**Putting it together: Pooling backward**

You now have everything you need to compute backward propagation on a pooling layer.

**Exercise**: Implement the `pool_backward` function in both modes (`"max"` and `"average"`). You will once again use 4 for-loops (iterating over training examples, height, width, and channels). You should use an `if/elif` statement to see if the mode is equal to `'max'` or `'average'`. If it is equal to 'average' you should use the `distribute_value()` function you implemented above to create a matrix of the same shape as `a_slice`. Otherwise, the mode is equal to '`max`', and you will create a mask with `create_mask_from_window()` and multiply it by the corresponding value of dZ.

## TensorFlow model

##Create placeholders

Implement the function below to create placeholders for the input image X and the output Y. You should not define the number of training examples for the moment. To do so, you could use "None" as the batch size, it will give you the flexibility to choose it later. Hence X should be of dimension **[None, n_H0, n_W0, n_C0]** and Y should be of dimension **[None, n_y]**. [Hint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder). 

```Python
def create_placeholders(n_H0, n_W0, n_C0, n_y):
    """
    Creates the placeholders for the tensorflow session.
    
    Arguments:
    n_H0 -- scalar, height of an input image
    n_W0 -- scalar, width of an input image
    n_C0 -- scalar, number of channels of the input
    n_y -- scalar, number of classes
        
    Returns:
    X -- placeholder for the data input, of shape [None, n_H0, n_W0, n_C0] and dtype "float"
    Y -- placeholder for the input labels, of shape [None, n_y] and dtype "float"
    """

    X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, n_H0, n_W0, n_C0))
    Y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32,shape=(None,n_y))
    
    return X, Y
```

##Initialize parameters

You will initialize weights/filters $W_1$ and $W_2$ using  `tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(seed = 0)`. You don't need to worry about bias variables as you will soon see that TensorFlow functions take care of the bias. Note also that you will only initialize the weights/filters for the conv2d functions. TensorFlow initializes the layers for the fully connected part automatically.  

Reminder - to initialize a parameter W of shape [1,2,3,4] in Tensorflow, use:

```
W = tf.get_variable("W", [1,2,3,4], initializer = ...)
```

[More Info](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/get_variable).

```python
def initialize_parameters():
    """
    Initializes weight parameters to build a neural network with tensorflow. The shapes are:
                        W1 : [4, 4, 3, 8]
                        W2 : [2, 2, 8, 16]
    Returns:
    parameters -- a dictionary of tensors containing W1, W2
    """
    
    tf.set_random_seed(1)                              # so that your "random" numbers match ours
        
    W1 =tf.get_variable('W1',[4,4,3,8],initializer=tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(seed = 0))
    W2 = tf.get_variable('W2',[2,2,8,16],initializer=tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(seed = 0))
    parameters = {"W1": W1,
                  "W2": W2}
    
    return parameters
```

```python
tf.reset_default_graph()
with tf.Session() as sess_test:
    parameters = initialize_parameters()
    init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
    sess_test.run(init)
    print("W1 = " + str(parameters["W1"].eval()[1,1,1]))
    print("W2 = " + str(parameters["W2"].eval()[1,1,1]))
