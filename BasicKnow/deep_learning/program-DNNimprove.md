# Initialization

A well chosen initialization can:

- Speed up the convergence of gradient descent
- Increase the odds of gradient descent converging to a lower training (and generalization) error

3种方法

- *Zeros initialization* -- setting `initialization = "zeros"` in the input argument.
- *Random initialization* -- setting `initialization = "random"` in the input argument. This initializes the weights to large random values.
- *He initialization* -- setting `initialization = "he"` in the input argument. This initializes the weights to random values scaled according to a paper by He et al., 2015.

## Zero initialization

In general, initializing all the weights to zero results in the network failing to break symmetry. This means that every neuron in each layer will learn the same thing, and you might as well be training a neural network with $n^{[l]}=1$ for every layer, and the network is no more powerful than a linear classifier such as logistic regression.

```python
def initialize_parameters_zeros(layers_dims):
    """
    Arguments:
    layer_dims -- python array (list) containing the size of each layer.
    
    Returns:
    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters "W1", "b1", ..., "WL", "bL":
                    W1 -- weight matrix of shape (layers_dims[1], layers_dims[0])
                    b1 -- bias vector of shape (layers_dims[1], 1)
                    ...
                    WL -- weight matrix of shape (layers_dims[L], layers_dims[L-1])
                    bL -- bias vector of shape (layers_dims[L], 1)
    """
    
    parameters = {}
    L = len(layers_dims)            # number of layers in the network
    
    for l in range(1, L):
        ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 2 lines of code)
        parameters['W' + str(l)] = np.zeros((layers_dims[l], layers_dims[l-1]))
        parameters['b' + str(l)] = 0
        ### END CODE HERE ###
    return parameters
```


**What you should remember**:

- The weights $W^{[l]}$ should be initialized randomly to break symmetry. 
- It is however okay to initialize the biases $b^{[l]}$ to zeros. Symmetry is still broken so long as $W^{[l]}$ is initialized randomly.

## Random initialization

```python
def initialize_parameters_random(layers_dims):
    """
    Arguments:
    layer_dims -- python array (list) containing the size of each layer.
    
    Returns:
    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters "W1", "b1", ..., "WL", "bL":
                    W1 -- weight matrix of shape (layers_dims[1], layers_dims[0])

                    ...
                    WL -- weight matrix of shape (layers_dims[L], layers_dims[L-1])
                    bL -- bias vector of shape (layers_dims[L], 1)
    """
    
    # np.random.seed(3)               # This seed makes sure your "random" numbers will be the as ours
    parameters = {}
    L = len(layers_dims)            # integer representing the number of layers
    
    for l in range(1, L):
        ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 2 lines of code)
        parameters['W' + str(l)] = np.random.randn(layers_dims[l], layers_dims[l-1]) * 10
        parameters['b' + str(l)] = np.zeros((layers_dims[l],1))
        ### END CODE HERE ###

    return parameters
```

**In summary**:

- Initializing weights to very large random values does not work well. 
- Hopefully intializing with small random values does better. The important question is: how small should be these random values be? Lets find out in the next part! 

## He initialization

Finally, try "He Initialization"; this is named for the first author of He et al., 2015. (If you have heard of "Xavier initialization", this is similar except Xavier initialization uses a scaling factor for the weights $W^{[l]}$ of `sqrt(1./layers_dims[l-1])` where He initialization would use `sqrt(2./layers_dims[l-1])`.)

**Hint**: This function is similar to the previous `initialize_parameters_random(...)`. The only difference is that instead of multiplying `np.random.randn(..,..)` by 10, you will multiply it by $\sqrt{\frac{2}{\text{dimension of the previous layer}}}$, which is what He initialization recommends for layers with a ReLU activation. 

```python
def initialize_parameters_he(layers_dims):
    """
    Arguments:
    layer_dims -- python array (list) containing the size of each layer.
    
    Returns:
    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters "W1", "b1", ..., "WL", "bL":
                    W1 -- weight matrix of shape (layers_dims[1], layers_dims[0])
                    b1 -- bias vector of shape (layers_dims[1], 1)
                    ...
                    WL -- weight matrix of shape (layers_dims[L], layers_dims[L-1])
                    bL -- bias vector of shape (layers_dims[L], 1)
    """
    
    np.random.seed(3)
    parameters = {}
    L = len(layers_dims) - 1 # integer representing the number of layers
     
    for l in range(1, L + 1):
        ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 2 lines of code)
        parameters['W' + str(l)] = np.random.randn(layers_dims[l], layers_dims[l-1]) * np.sqrt(2/layers_dims[l-1])
        parameters['b' + str(l)] = np.zeros((layers_dims[l],1))
        ### END CODE HERE ###
        
    return parameters
```

**What you should remember from this notebook**:

- Different initializations lead to different results
- Random initialization is used to break symmetry and make sure different hidden units can learn different things
- Don't intialize to values that are too large
- He initialization works well for networks with ReLU activations. 

# Regularization

## L2 Regularization

The standard way to avoid overfitting is called **L2 regularization**. It consists of appropriately modifying your cost function, from:
$$J = -\frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{m} \large{(}\small  y^{(i)}\log\left(a^{[L](i)}\right) + (1-y^{(i)})\log\left(1- a^{[L](i)}\right) \large{)} \tag{1}$$
To:
$$J_{regularized} = \small \underbrace{-\frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{m} \large{(}\small y^{(i)}\log\left(a^{[L](i)}\right) + (1-y^{(i)})\log\left(1- a^{[L](i)}\right) \large{)} }_\text{cross-entropy cost} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{m} \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum\limits_l\sum\limits_k\sum\limits_j W_{k,j}^{[l]2} }_\text{L2 regularization cost} \tag{2}$$

Let's modify your cost and observe the consequences.

```python
def compute_cost_with_regularization(A3, Y, parameters, lambd):
    """
    Implement the cost function with L2 regularization. See formula (2) above.
    
    Arguments:

    parameters -- python dictionary containing parameters of the model
    
    Returns:
    cost - value of the regularized loss function (formula (2))
    """
    m = Y.shape[1]
    W1 = parameters["W1"]
    W2 = parameters["W2"]
    W3 = parameters["W3"]
    
    cross_entropy_cost = compute_cost(A3, Y) # This gives you the cross-entropy part of the cost
    
    ### START CODE HERE ### (approx. 1 line)
    L2_regularization_cost = 1/m * lambd/2 * (np.sum(np.square(W1))+np.sum(np.square(W2))+np.sum(np.square(W3)))
    ### END CODER HERE ###
    
    cost = cross_entropy_cost + L2_regularization_cost
    
    return cost
```

Of course, because you changed the cost, you have to change backward propagation as well! All the gradients have to be computed with respect to this new cost.

Implement the changes needed in backward propagation to take into account regularization. The changes only concern dW1, dW2 and dW3. For each, you have to add the regularization term's gradient ($\frac{d}{dW} ( \frac{1}{2}\frac{\lambda}{m}  W^2) = \frac{\lambda}{m} W$).

                 "dZ1": dZ1, "dW1": dW1, "db1": db1}
    
    return gradients
```

**Observations**:

- The value of $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter that you can tune using a dev set.
- L2 regularization makes your decision boundary smoother. If $\lambda$ is too large, it is also possible to "oversmooth", resulting in a model with high bias.

**What is L2-regularization actually doing?**:

L2-regularization relies on the assumption that a model with small weights is simpler than a model with large weights. Thus, by penalizing the square values of the weights in the cost function you drive all the weights to smaller values. It becomes too costly for the cost to have large weights! This leads to a smoother model in which the output changes more slowly as the input changes. 

**What you should remember** -- the implications of L2-regularization on:
- The cost computation:
    - A regularization term is added to the cost
- The backpropagation function:
    - There are extra terms in the gradients with respect to weight matrices
- Weights end up smaller ("weight decay"): 
    - Weights are pushed to smaller values.

## Dropout

Finally, **dropout** is a widely used regularization technique that is specific to deep learning. **It randomly shuts down some neurons in each iteration.**

When you shut some neurons down, you actually modify your model. The idea behind drop-out is that at each iteration, you train a different model that uses only a subset of your neurons. With dropout, your neurons thus become less sensitive to the activation of one other specific neuron, because that other neuron might be shut down at any time.

### Forward propagation with dropout

Implement the forward propagation with dropout. You are using a 3 layer neural network, and will add dropout to the first and second hidden layers. We will not apply dropout to the input layer or output layer. 

**Instructions**:
You would like to shut down some neurons in the first and second layers. To do that, you are going to carry out 4 Steps:
1. In lecture, we dicussed creating a variable $d^{[1]}$ with the same shape as $a^{[1]}$ using `np.random.rand()` to randomly get numbers between 0 and 1. Here, you will use a vectorized implementation, so create a random matrix $D^{[1]} = [d^{[1](1)} d^{[1](2)} ... d^{[1](m)}] $ of the same dimension as $A^{[1]}$.
2. Set each entry of $D^{[1]}$ to be 0 with probability (`1-keep_prob`) or 1 with probability (`keep_prob`), by thresholding values in $D^{[1]}$ appropriately. Hint: to set all the entries of a matrix X to 0 (if entry is less than 0.5) or 1 (if entry is more than 0.5) you would do: `X = (X < 0.5)`. Note that 0 and 1 are respectively equivalent to False and True.
3. Set $A^{[1]}$ to $A^{[1]} * D^{[1]}$. (You are shutting down some neurons). You can think of $D^{[1]}$ as a mask, so that when it is multiplied with another matrix, it shuts down some of the values.
4. Divide $A^{[1]}$ by `keep_prob`. By doing this you are assuring that the result of the cost will still have the same expected value as without drop-out. (This technique is also called inverted dropout.)

### Backward propagation with dropout

Implement the backward propagation with dropout. As before, you are training a 3 layer network. Add dropout to the first and second hidden layers, using the masks $D^{[1]}$ and $D^{[2]}$ stored in the cache. 

**Instruction**:
Backpropagation with dropout is actually quite easy. You will have to carry out 2 Steps:
1. You had previously shut down some neurons during forward propagation, by applying a mask $D^{[1]}$ to `A1`. In backpropagation, you will have to shut down the same neurons, by reapplying the same mask $D^{[1]}$ to `dA1`. 
2. During forward propagation, you had divided `A1` by `keep_prob`. In backpropagation, you'll therefore have to divide `dA1` by `keep_prob` again (the calculus interpretation is that if $A^{[1]}$ is scaled by `keep_prob`, then its derivative $dA^{[1]}$ is also scaled by the same `keep_prob`).

```python
def backward_propagation_with_dropout(X, Y, cache, keep_prob):
    """

                 "dZ1": dZ1, "dW1": dW1, "db1": db1}
    
    return gradients
```

**Note**:

- A **common mistake** when using dropout is to use it both in training and testing. You should use dropout (randomly eliminate nodes) only in training. 
- Deep learning frameworks like [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/dropout), [PaddlePaddle](http://doc.paddlepaddle.org/release_doc/0.9.0/doc/ui/api/trainer_config_helpers/attrs.html), [keras](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout) or [caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/layers/dropout.html) come with a dropout layer implementation. Don't stress - you will soon learn some of these frameworks.

**What you should remember about dropout:**
- Dropout is a regularization technique.
- You only use dropout during training. Don't use dropout (randomly eliminate nodes) during test time.
- Apply dropout both during forward and backward propagation.
- During training time, divide each dropout layer by keep_prob to keep the same expected value for the activations. For example, if keep_prob is 0.5, then we will on average shut down half the nodes, so the output will be scaled by 0.5 since only the remaining half are contributing to the solution. Dividing by 0.5 is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Hence, the output now has the same expected value. You can check that this works even when keep_prob is other values than 0.5. 

# Gradient Checking

## 1) How does gradient checking work?

Backpropagation computes the gradients $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta}$, where $\theta$ denotes the parameters of the model. $J$ is computed using forward propagation and your loss function.

Because forward propagation is relatively easy to implement, you're confident you got that right, and so you're almost  100% sure that you're computing the cost $J$ correctly. Thus, you can use your code for computing $J$ to verify the code for computing $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta}$. 

Let's look back at the definition of a derivative (or gradient):
$$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta} = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{J(\theta + \varepsilon) - J(\theta - \varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon} \tag{1}$$

If you're not familiar with the "$\displaystyle \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}$" notation, it's just a way of saying "when $\varepsilon$ is really really small."

We know the following:

- $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta}$ is what you want to make sure you're computing correctly. 
- You can compute $J(\theta + \varepsilon)$ and $J(\theta - \varepsilon)$ (in the case that $\theta$ is a real number), since you're confident your implementation for $J$ is correct. 

Lets use equation (1) and a small value for $\varepsilon$ to convince your CEO that your code for computing  $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta}$ is correct!

## 2) 1-dimensional gradient checking

**Instructions**:

- First compute "gradapprox" using the formula above (1) and a small value of $\varepsilon$. Here are the Steps to follow:
    1. $\theta^{+} = \theta + \varepsilon$
    2. $\theta^{-} = \theta - \varepsilon$
    3. $J^{+} = J(\theta^{+})$
    4. $J^{-} = J(\theta^{-})$
    5. $gradapprox = \frac{J^{+} - J^{-}}{2  \varepsilon}$
- Then compute the gradient using backward propagation, and store the result in a variable "grad"
- Finally, compute the relative difference between "gradapprox" and the "grad" using the following formula:
  $$ difference = \frac {\mid\mid grad - gradapprox \mid\mid_2}{\mid\mid grad \mid\mid_2 + \mid\mid gradapprox \mid\mid_2} \tag{2}$$
  You will need 3 Steps to compute this formula:
   - 1'. compute the numerator using np.linalg.norm(...)
   - 2'. compute the denominator. You will need to call np.linalg.norm(...) twice.
   - 3'. divide them.
- If this difference is small (say less than $10^{-7}$), you can be quite confident that you have computed your gradient correctly. Otherwise, there may be a mistake in the gradient computation. 

```python
def gradient_check(x, theta, epsilon = 1e-7):
    """

## 3) N-dimensional gradient checking

**How does gradient checking work?**.

As in 1) and 2), you want to compare "gradapprox" to the gradient computed by backpropagation. The formula is still:

$$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta} = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{J(\theta + \varepsilon) - J(\theta - \varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon} \tag{1}$$

However, $\theta$ is not a scalar anymore. It is a dictionary called "parameters". We implemented a function "`dictionary_to_vector()`" for you. It converts the "parameters" dictionary into a vector called "values", obtained by reshaping all parameters (W1, b1, W2, b2, W3, b3) into vectors and concatenating them.

The inverse function is "`vector_to_dictionary`" which outputs back the "parameters" dictionary.

![dictionary_to_vector](img/dictionary_to_vector.png)

**Figure 2** : **dictionary_to_vector() and vector_to_dictionary()**

You will need these functions in gradient_check_n()

We have also converted the "gradients" dictionary into a vector "grad" using gradients_to_vector(). You don't need to worry about that.

**Instructions**: Here is pseudo-code that will help you implement the gradient check.

For each i in num_parameters:
- To compute `J_plus[i]`:
    1. Set $\theta^{+}$ to `np.copy(parameters_values)`
    2. Set $\theta^{+}_i$ to $\theta^{+}_i + \varepsilon$
    3. Calculate $J^{+}_i$ using to `forward_propagation_n(x, y, vector_to_dictionary(`$\theta^{+}$ `))`.     
- To compute `J_minus[i]`: do the same thing with $\theta^{-}$
- Compute $gradapprox[i] = \frac{J^{+}_i - J^{-}_i}{2 \varepsilon}$

Thus, you get a vector gradapprox, where gradapprox[i] is an approximation of the gradient with respect to `parameter_values[i]`. You can now compare this gradapprox vector to the gradients vector from backpropagation. Just like for the 1D case (Steps 1', 2', 3'), compute: 
$$ difference = \frac {\| grad - gradapprox \|_2}{\| grad \|_2 + \| gradapprox \|_2 } \tag{3}$$

##Note

- Gradient Checking is slow! Approximating the gradient with $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta} \approx  \frac{J(\theta + \varepsilon) - J(\theta - \varepsilon)}{2 \varepsilon}$ is computationally costly. For this reason, we don't run gradient checking at every iteration during training. Just a few times to check if the gradient is correct. 
- Gradient Checking, at least as we've presented it, doesn't work with dropout. You would usually run the gradient check algorithm without dropout to make sure your backprop is correct, then add dropout. 

**What you should remember from this notebook**:

- Gradient checking verifies closeness between the gradients from backpropagation and the numerical approximation of the gradient (computed using forward propagation).
- Gradient checking is slow, so we don't run it in every iteration of training. You would usually run it only to make sure your code is correct, then turn it off and use backprop for the actual learning process.

    return parameters
```

- **(Batch) Gradient Descent**:

``` python
X = data_input
Y = labels
parameters = initialize_parameters(layers_dims)
for i in range(0, num_iterations):
    # Forward propagation
    a, caches = forward_propagation(X, parameters)
    # Compute cost.
    cost = compute_cost(a, Y)
    # Backward propagation.
    grads = backward_propagation(a, caches, parameters)
    # Update parameters.
    parameters = update_parameters(parameters, grads)
        
```

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**:

```python
X = data_input
Y = labels
parameters = initialize_parameters(layers_dims)
for i in range(0, num_iterations):
    for j in range(0, m):
        # Forward propagation
        a, caches = forward_propagation(X[:,j], parameters)
        # Compute cost
        cost = compute_cost(a, Y[:,j])
        # Backward propagation
        grads = backward_propagation(a, caches, parameters)
        # Update parameters.
        parameters = update_parameters(parameters, grads)
```
In Stochastic Gradient Descent, you use only 1 training example before updating the gradients. When the training set is large, SGD can be faster. But the parameters will "oscillate" toward the minimum rather than converge smoothly. 

**Note** also that implementing SGD requires 3 for-loops in total:

1. Over the number of iterations
2. Over the $m$ training examples
3. Over the layers (to update all parameters, from $(W^{[1]},b^{[1]})$ to $(W^{[L]},b^{[L]})$)

In practice, you'll often get faster results if you do not use neither the whole training set, nor only one training example, to perform each update. Mini-batch gradient descent uses an intermediate number of examples for each step. With mini-batch gradient descent, you loop over the mini-batches instead of looping over individual training examples.

**What you should remember**:

- The difference between gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent is the number of examples you use to perform one update step.
- You have to tune a learning rate hyperparameter $\alpha$.
- With a well-turned mini-batch size, usually it outperforms either gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent (particularly when the training set is large).

## 2 - Mini-Batch Gradient descent

Let's learn how to build mini-batches from the training set (X, Y).

There are two steps:
- **Shuffle**: Create a shuffled version of the training set (X, Y) as shown below. Each column of X and Y represents a training example. Note that the random shuffling is done synchronously between X and Y. Such that after the shuffling the $i^{th}$ column of X is the example corresponding to the $i^{th}$ label in Y. The shuffling step ensures that examples will be split randomly into different mini-batches. 

![kiank_shuffle](img/kiank_shuffle.png)

- **Partition**: Partition the shuffled (X, Y) into mini-batches of size `mini_batch_size` (here 64). Note that the number of training examples is not always divisible by `mini_batch_size`. The last mini batch might be smaller, but you don't need to worry about this. When the final mini-batch is smaller than the full `mini_batch_size`, it will look like this: 

![kiank_partition](img/kiank_partition.png)

selects the indexes for the $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ mini-batches:
```python
first_mini_batch_X = shuffled_X[:, 0 : mini_batch_size]
second_mini_batch_X = shuffled_X[:, mini_batch_size : 2 * mini_batch_size]
...
```

Note that the last mini-batch might end up smaller than `mini_batch_size=64`. Let $\lfloor s \rfloor$ represents $s$ rounded down to the nearest integer (this is `math.floor(s)` in Python). If the total number of examples is not a multiple of `mini_batch_size=64` then there will be $\lfloor \frac{m}{mini\_batch\_size}\rfloor$ mini-batches with a full 64 examples, and the number of examples in the final mini-batch will be ($m-mini_\_batch_\_size \times \lfloor \frac{m}{mini\_batch\_size}\rfloor$). 

```python
def random_mini_batches(X, Y, mini_batch_size = 64, seed = 0):
    """

    Arguments:

    Returns:

    """
    
    np.random.seed(seed)            # To make your "random" minibatches the same as ours

    mini_batches = []
        
    # Step 1: Shuffle (X, Y)
    permutation = list(np.random.permutation(m))
    shuffled_X = X[:, permutation]
    shuffled_Y = Y[:, permutation].reshape((1,m))

    # Step 2: Partition (shuffled_X, shuffled_Y). Minus the end case.
    num_complete_minibatches = math.floor(m/mini_batch_size) # number of mini batches of size mini_batch_size in your partitionning
    for k in range(0, num_complete_minibatches):
        ### START CODE HERE ### (approx. 2 lines)
        mini_batch_X = shuffled_X[:, k*mini_batch_size:(k+1)*mini_batch_size]
        mini_batch_Y = shuffled_Y[:, k*mini_batch_size:(k+1)*mini_batch_size]
        ### END CODE HERE ###
        mini_batch = (mini_batch_X, mini_batch_Y)
        mini_batches.append(mini_batch)
    
    # Handling the end case (last mini-batch < mini_batch_size)
    if m % mini_batch_size != 0:
        ### START CODE HERE ### (approx. 2 lines)

        ### END CODE HERE ###
        mini_batch = (mini_batch_X, mini_batch_Y)
        mini_batches.append(mini_batch)
    
    return mini_batches
```

**Note**:Powers of two are often chosen to be the mini-batch size, e.g., 16, 32, 64, 128.

## 3 - Momentum

Because mini-batch gradient descent makes a parameter update after seeing just a subset of examples, the direction of the update has some variance, and so the path taken by mini-batch gradient descent will "oscillate" toward convergence. Using momentum can reduce these oscillations. 

Momentum takes into account the past gradients to smooth out the update. We will store the 'direction' of the previous gradients in the variable $v$. Formally, this will be the exponentially weighted average of the gradient on previous steps. You can also think of $v$ as the "velocity" of a ball rolling downhill, building up speed (and momentum) according to the direction of the gradient/slope of the hill. 

![opt_momentum](img/opt_momentum.png)
**Figure 3**: The red arrows shows the direction taken by one step of mini-batch gradient descent with momentum. The blue points show the direction of the gradient (with respect to the current mini-batch) on each step. Rather than just following the gradient, we let the gradient influence $v$ and then take a step in the direction of $v$. 


**Exercise**: Initialize the velocity. The velocity, $v$, is a python dictionary that needs to be initialized with arrays of zeros. Its keys are the same as those in the `grads` dictionary, that is:
for $l =1,...,L$:
```python
v["dW" + str(l+1)] = ... #(numpy array of zeros with the same shape as parameters["W" + str(l+1)])
v["db" + str(l+1)] = ... #(numpy array of zeros with the same shape as parameters["b" + str(l+1)])
```
**Note** that the iterator l starts at 0 in the for loop while the first parameters are v["dW1"] and v["db1"] (that's a "one" on the superscript). This is why we are shifting l to l+1 in the `for` loop.

```python
def initialize_velocity(parameters):
    """
    Initializes the velocity as a python dictionary with:
                - keys: "dW1", "db1", ..., "dWL", "dbL"

    Arguments:
    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters.
                    parameters['W' + str(l)] = Wl
                    parameters['b' + str(l)] = bl
    
    Returns:
    v -- python dictionary containing the current velocity.
                    v['dW' + str(l)] = velocity of dWl
                    v['db' + str(l)] = velocity of dbl
    """
    
    L = len(parameters) // 2 # number of layers in the neural networks
    v = {}
    
    # Initialize velocity
    for l in range(L):
        ### START CODE HERE ### (approx. 2 lines)
        v["dW" + str(l+1)] = np.zeros_like(parameters['W'+str(l+1)])
        v["db" + str(l+1)] = np.zeros_like(parameters['b'+str(l+1)])
        ### END CODE HERE ###
        
    return v
```

**Exercise**:  Now, implement the parameters update with momentum. The momentum update rule is, for $l = 1, ..., L$: 

$$ \begin{cases}v_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta v_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta) dW^{[l]} \\W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha v_{dW^{[l]}}\end{cases}\tag{3}$$

$$\begin{cases}v_{db^{[l]}} = \beta v_{db^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta) db^{[l]} \\b^{[l]} = b^{[l]} - \alpha v_{db^{[l]}} \end{cases}\tag{4}$$

where L is the number of layers, $\beta$ is the momentum and $\alpha$ is the learning rate. All parameters should be stored in the `parameters` dictionary.  Note that the iterator `l` starts at 0 in the `for` loop while the first parameters are $W^{[1]}$ and $b^{[1]}$ (that's a "one" on the superscript). So you will need to shift `l` to `l+1` when coding.

```

**Note** that:

- The velocity is initialized with zeros. So the algorithm will take a few iterations to "build up" velocity and start to take bigger steps.
- If $\beta = 0$, then this just becomes standard gradient descent without momentum. 

**How do you choose $\beta$?**

- The larger the momentum $\beta$ is, the smoother the update because the more we take the past gradients into account. But if $\beta$ is too big, it could also smooth out the updates too much. 
- Common values for $\beta$ range from 0.8 to 0.999. If you don't feel inclined to tune this, $\beta = 0.9$ is often a reasonable default. 
- Tuning the optimal $\beta$ for your model might need trying several values to see what works best in term of reducing the value of the cost function $J$. 

**What you should remember**:

- Momentum takes past gradients into account to smooth out the steps of gradient descent. It can be applied with batch gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.
- You have to tune a momentum hyperparameter $\beta$ and a learning rate $\alpha$.

## 4 - Adam

Adam is one of the most effective optimization algorithms for training neural networks. It combines ideas from RMSProp (described in lecture) and Momentum. 

**How does Adam work?**
1. It calculates an exponentially weighted average of past gradients, and stores it in variables $v$ (before bias correction) and $v^{corrected}$ (with bias correction). 
2. It calculates an exponentially weighted average of the squares of the past gradients, and  stores it in variables $s$ (before bias correction) and $s^{corrected}$ (with bias correction). 
3. It updates parameters in a direction based on combining information from "1" and "2".

The update rule is, for $l = 1, ..., L$: 

$$\begin{cases}v_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_1 v_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_1) \frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{ \partial W^{[l]} } \\v^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{v_{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_1)^t} \\s_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_2 s_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_2) (\frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{\partial W^{[l]} })^2\\s^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{s_{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_1)^t} \\W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha \frac{v^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}}}{\sqrt{s^{corrected}_{dW^{[l]}}} + \varepsilon}\end{cases}$$
where:

- t counts the number of steps taken of Adam 
- L is the number of layers
- $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are hyperparameters that control the two exponentially weighted averages. 
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate
- $\varepsilon$ is a very small number to avoid dividing by zero

As usual, we will store all parameters in the `parameters` dictionary

**Exercise**: Initialize the Adam variables $v, s$ which keep track of the past information.

**Instruction**: The variables $v, s$ are python dictionaries that need to be initialized with arrays of zeros. Their keys are the same as for `grads`, that is:
for $l = 1, ..., L$:
```python
v["dW" + str(l+1)] = ... #(numpy array of zeros with the same shape as parameters["W" + str(l+1)])
v["db" + str(l+1)] = ... #(numpy array of zeros with the same shape as parameters["b" + str(l+1)])
s["dW" + str(l+1)] = ... #(numpy array of zeros with the same shape as parameters["W" + str(l+1)])
s["db" + str(l+1)] = ... #(numpy array of zeros with the same shape as parameters["b" + str(l+1)])
```
```python
def initialize_adam(parameters) :
    """

                - keys: "dW1", "db1", ..., "dWL", "dbL"

**summary**

Momentum usually helps, but given the small learning rate and the simplistic dataset, its impact is almost negligeable. Also, the huge oscillations you see in the cost come from the fact that some minibatches are more difficult thans others for the optimization algorithm.

Adam on the other hand, clearly outperforms mini-batch gradient descent and Momentum. If you run the model for more epochs on this simple dataset, all three methods will lead to very good results. However, you've seen that Adam converges a lot faster.

Some advantages of Adam include:
- Relatively low memory requirements (though higher than gradient descent and gradient descent with momentum) 
- Usually works well even with little tuning of hyperparameters (except $\alpha$)

# TensorFlow

## 1 - Exploring the Tensorflow Library

$$loss = \mathcal{L}(\hat{y}, y) = (\hat y^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2 \tag{1}$$

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.framework import ops
y_hat = tf.constant(36, name='y_hat')            # Define y_hat constant. Set to 36.
y = tf.constant(39, name='y')                    # Define y. Set to 39

loss = tf.Variable((y - y_hat)**2, name='loss')  # Create a variable for the loss

init = tf.global_variables_initializer()         # When init is run later (session.run(init)),
                                                 # the loss variable will be initialized and ready to be computed
with tf.Session() as session:                    # Create a session and print the output
    session.run(init)                            # Initializes the variables
    print(session.run(loss))                     # Prints the loss
```

Writing and running programs in TensorFlow has the following steps:

1. Create Tensors (variables) that are not yet executed/evaluated. 
2. Write operations between those Tensors.
3. Initialize your Tensors. 
4. Create a Session. 
5. Run the Session. This will run the operations you'd written above. 

Therefore, when we created a variable for the loss, we simply defined the loss as a function of other quantities, but did not evaluate its value. To evaluate it, we had to run `init=tf.global_variables_initializer()`. That initialized the loss variable, and in the last line we were finally able to evaluate the value of `loss` and print its value.

**remember to initialize your variables, create a session and run the operations inside the session**.



Next, you'll also have to know about placeholders. A placeholder is an object whose value you can specify only later. 
To specify values for a placeholder, you can pass in values by using a "feed dictionary" (`feed_dict` variable). Below, we created a placeholder for x. This allows us to pass in a number later when we run the session. 

```python
x = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, name = 'x')
print(sess.run(2 * x, feed_dict = {x: 3}))
sess.close()
```

When you first defined `x` you did not have to specify a value for it. A placeholder is simply a variable that you will assign data to only later, when running the session. We say that you **feed data** to these placeholders when running the session. 

Here's what's happening: When you specify the operations needed for a computation, you are telling TensorFlow how to construct a computation graph. The computation graph can have some placeholders whose values you will specify only later. Finally, when you run the session, you are telling TensorFlow to execute the computation graph.

### 2.1 - Create placeholders

```python
def create_placeholders(n_x, n_y):
    """
    Creates the placeholders for the tensorflow session.
    
    Arguments:
    n_x -- scalar, size of an image vector (num_px * num_px = 64 * 64 * 3 = 12288)
    n_y -- scalar, number of classes (from 0 to 5, so -> 6)
    
    Returns:
    X -- placeholder for the data input, of shape [n_x, None] and dtype "float"
    Y -- placeholder for the input labels, of shape [n_y, None] and dtype "float"
    
    Tips:
    - You will use None because it let's us be flexible on the number of examples you will for the placeholders.
      In fact, the number of examples during test/train is different.
    """

    ### START CODE HERE ### (approx. 2 lines)
    X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(n_x,None), name="X")
    Y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(n_y,None), name="Y")
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return X, Y
```

### 2.2 - Initializing the parameters

```python
def initialize_parameters():
    """

```

### 2.3 - Forward propagation in tensorflow

**Question:** Implement the forward pass of the neural network. We commented for you the numpy equivalents so that you can compare the tensorflow implementation to numpy. It is important to note that the forward propagation stops at `z3`. The reason is that in tensorflow the last linear layer output is given as input to the function computing the loss. Therefore, you don't need `a3`!

```python
def forward_propagation(X, parameters):
    """
    Implements the forward propagation for the model: LINEAR -> RELU -> LINEAR -> RELU -> LINEAR -> SOFTMAX
    
    Arguments:
    X -- input dataset placeholder, of shape (input size, number of examples)
    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters "W1", "b1", "W2", "b2", "W3", "b3"
                  the shapes are given in initialize_parameters

    Returns:
    Z3 -- the output of the last LINEAR unit
    """
    
    # Retrieve the parameters from the dictionary "parameters" 
    W1 = parameters['W1']
    b1 = parameters['b1']
    W2 = parameters['W2']
    b2 = parameters['b2']
    W3 = parameters['W3']
    b3 = parameters['b3']
    
    ### START CODE HERE ### (approx. 5 lines)              # Numpy Equivalents:
    Z1 = tf.matmul(W1, X)+b1                               # Z1 = np.dot(W1, X) + b1
    A1 = tf.nn.relu(Z1)                                    # A1 = relu(Z1)
    Z2 = tf.matmul(W2, A1)+b2                              # Z2 = np.dot(W2, a1) + b2
    A2 = tf.nn.relu(Z2)                                    # A2 = relu(Z2)
    Z3 = tf.matmul(W3, A2)+b3                              # Z3 = np.dot(W3,Z2) + b3
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return Z3
```

### 2.4 Compute cost

**Question**: Implement the cost function below. 

- It is important to know that the "`logits`" and "`labels`" inputs of `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` are expected to be of shape (number of examples, num_classes). We have thus transposed Z3 and Y for you.
- Besides, `tf.reduce_mean` basically does the summation over the examples.

```python
def compute_cost(Z3, Y):
    """
    Computes the cost
    
    Arguments:
    Z3 -- output of forward propagation (output of the last LINEAR unit), of shape (6, number of examples)
    Y -- "true" labels vector placeholder, same shape as Z3
    
    Returns:
    cost - Tensor of the cost function
    """
    
    # to fit the tensorflow requirement for tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(...,...)
    logits = tf.transpose(Z3)
    labels = tf.transpose(Y)
    
    ### START CODE HERE ### (1 line of code)
    cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits = logits, labels = labels))
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return cost
```

### 2.5 - Backward propagation & parameter updates

All the backpropagation and the parameters update is taken care of in 1 line of code. It is very easy to incorporate this line in the model.

After you compute the cost function. You will create an "`optimizer`" object. You have to call this object along with the cost when running the tf.session. When called, it will perform an optimization on the given cost with the chosen method and learning rate.

For instance, for gradient descent the optimizer would be:
```python
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate = learning_rate).minimize(cost)
```

To make the optimization you would do:
```python
_ , c = sess.run([optimizer, cost], feed_dict={X: minibatch_X, Y: minibatch_Y})
```

This computes the backpropagation by passing through the tensorflow graph in the reverse order. From cost to inputs.

**Note** When coding, we often use `_` as a "throwaway" variable to store values that we won't need to use later. Here, `_` takes on the evaluated value of `optimizer`, which we don't need (and `c` takes the value of the `cost` variable). 

### 2.6 - Building the model

```python
def model(X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test, learning_rate = 0.0001,
          num_epochs = 1500, minibatch_size = 32, print_cost = True):
    """

## Summary

**What you should remember**:

- Tensorflow is a programming framework used in deep learning
- The two main object classes in tensorflow are Tensors and Operators. 
- When you code in tensorflow you have to take the following steps:
    - Create a graph containing Tensors (Variables, Placeholders ...) and Operations (tf.matmul, tf.add, ...)
    - Create a session
    - Initialize the session
    - Run the session to execute the graph
- You can execute the graph multiple times as you've seen in model()
- The backpropagation and optimization is automatically done when running the session on the "optimizer" object.
